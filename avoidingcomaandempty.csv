1,The Sahaja Marriage list,,We have to spend so much time to find somebody for you,"  Some people also are getting married. I must tell them they better decide now‚ because I've seen that so many of you start thinking after the marriage‚ which is very cruel‚ which is very indecent. So better to decide now. Actually those who do not want to marry should not give us their names‚ should not. Because you don't know how much time we have to spend in sorting out these things to find out somebody for you. It's such a waste of time. And when we fix it up‚ we do it then suddenly somebody comes up: ""Ah‚ I don't want to get married"". Surprising. They have no shame about it‚ they don't understand. How much you have made Me work for that‚ how much I have gone through it and then suddenly you come and say: ""No we don't want to get married"". Such people should not apply for marriage. Next time if somebody does that I'll forbid that person to come to India‚ I must tell you. For days together you know we used to sleep at two o'clock three o'clock discussing whom to marry whom. Ah if you don't like particular person I can understand‚ but you shouldn't say I don't want to marry.

90,Why should we marry?,https://youtu.be/tg-1tzZw2MI,," Marriage is meant to give joy‚ is meant to give cheerfulness‚ happiness and all the blissful things that we can think of achieving through our combination with two human beings‚ we can say. It's a very close and private relationship which has to be respected. It is not to be in any way dishonoured or indiscreetly squandered away. Those who cannot respect their partners in life will never be respected anywhere else. Those who ill-treat or in any way try to spoil the image of their partners are harming themselves.
Try to understand each other‚ decorate each other‚ not correction‚ but decorating. Like an ornament‚ when added to a personality decorates that person‚ in the same way‚ try to decorate another person. So the decorum and decency of life comes from this auspicious relationship. That must be maintained. Marriage is the bondage that keeps the society in its own beautiful bondage of Mother's grace.

One should behave in a way that a man is. And let him‚ let them be men‚ and you have to be women. To be a woman is a very big thing. Your mother is a woman. You know how great it is to be a woman. It's very great to be a woman because women have such powers. We have really‚ by competing with men‚ we have finished ourselves completely. So the two roles of men and woman is like the‚ I would say‚ the flower and the fragrance. Which is higher: flower or the fragrance? If there is no flower‚ there is no fragrance. But without fragrance what is a flower? Or beauty? It is so much inseparable‚ fragrance and beauty and flower. In the same way the flower shows‚ but who is the beauty‚ and who is the fragrance is the wife. That is how it should be. And then only people will respect you and your husband.

Now‚ he has to be the head‚ the man has to be head for certain reasons. There is nothing wrong in man becoming the head‚ it's all right – you become the heart. Heart is more important than head is. Perhaps‚ we do not realize that how heart is important. You see‚ even if the head fails‚ the heart can go on. We can go on always up till the heart is going on. But‚ if the heart fails‚ the head fails too.

So you are the heart as a woman‚ and he is the head of the family. Let him have that feeling that he is the head; it's a feeling‚ just a feeling. Like the head always feels that he decides. But‚ it's the brain that also knows that it's the heart one has to cater for. Is the heart which is all- pervading‚ which is the real source of everything.

So the woman's position‚ if she understands how important it is‚ she would never feel let down or dominated if she knows she's the heart.

In this case the women have to nourish the organization‚ nourish the husband with love from their heart and not from their brains.

I think it's so great to have been born as a woman Myself‚ because I can enjoy the heart‚ the emotions. The emotions of My love‚ the working and the play of My love. It's so great that no incarnation can enjoy that as I can. So the women should not feel degraded if they have to look after the heart‚ but they are in a higher‚ in a way‚ in a higher aspect. You can do without thinking but you cannot do without the heart.

So the ladies should not argue with their husbands if they are leaders‚ and also one should not argue otherwise‚ also. Because I have seen if the women are very argumentative‚ the men become deaf. They just don't listen what women are talking. If they are very aggressive‚ then the men become absolutely shut up.

And you have to see that you behave in such a manner that you create a proper motherhood within yourself and a discipline that you want your children to imbibe and your husband to have. You have seen your Mother‚ own Mother has been sitting for 9-10 hours‚ sometimes‚ at one place‚ not even getting out of this place. But I have seen people that they can't sit for two hours in a place‚ even if they are meditating. And they will get up‚ disturb everybody else and get down. It's a sign that we lack in our discipline. That our parents did not discipline us. That we did not discipline ourselves. So now first thing is that you have to have a perfect discipline of your temperament‚ and is a sign that you are the people who represent this Mother Earth‚ who have a special wisdom and a special power to express that wisdom. So all of you have to be extremely careful that whatever you do will be reflected in the whole family and in the whole Sahaja Yoga system. Now when you get married to your husbands try to understand that you are the mother earth. And you have to give‚ and because you have powers you can give. Because you have so many shaktis within you‚ you have to give. That means you are superior in a way that you can give. So that your ego should not stand up at all the time and say ""Why should 1 do‚ why should I?"" And then you will start enjoying this womanhood.

So try to be good mothers‚ good wives and responsible Sahaja Yogis. Those who after marriage‚ try to deviate their husbands from Sahaja Yoga are really the most cursed ones.

What does it matter? 1 mean what comfort can anybody give to a housewife? She is the one who is the source of comfort; what comfort can you give her?

So this is what one has to know‚ that a Gruha Lakshmi is the woman in the family‚ She is the Gruha Lakshmi. But the man should not be a wolf‚ also a Gruha Lakshmi cannot marry a wolf‚ you must understand. If the man is a wolf‚ then he doesn't deserve to have a Gruha Lakshmi but he can have a she-wolf as his wife; that's a good idea. Then they can fight‚ quarrel‚ have all kinds of divorces. But it's the responsibility of the Gruha Lakshmi to begin with‚ I must say. To keep the balance it is her duty‚ it is not the duty of the other people in the family.

You should not mind giving up anything to anyone if they want. You will enjoy your generosity now and in that you should be generous when you forgive others. Forgiveness is very important‚ and then you will never feel the brunt of your married life.

Forgive. Also you have to forgive yourself. Not to feel guilty‚ not to feel guilty at all about anything‚ because after all you are also Sahaja Yogis‚ and if you have done anything wrong‚ it's all right‚ doesn't matter. But you should have the sweetness‚ the sweetness of a wife who will emit love and peace to others.

You should not be source of some sort of a dominating personality or a person who is aggressive‚ not at all. On the contrary you are the one who can bear lots of things and make a fun out of every nonsense that you see. Nothing is so serious to fight it‚ but to make a fun out of all that and make a fun for every one. That's what you have to be‚ always smiling and happy. You will be amazed‚ you can make beautiful marriages for yourself‚ for your husband and all for Sahaja Yoga. So I am also very sure‚ if you make a successful marriage‚ you will have very‚ very good children who will be born realized. So you should be good mothers. Mothers who can really do good to the children and to other children also. All that is stored for you in future.

I know you'll all be enjoying very much your future life and make it so beautiful that everybody should talk‚ that ""look at these Sahaja Yoginis‚ how they have made their lives happy!"" It's a very‚ very important thing that we should pay attention to our own mistakes than to the mistakes of others‚ and try to correct them. See‚ they are themselves capable of looking after themselves. Only you should care for them and also you should in every way be very kind and gentle. I am sure you all can make very‚ very good families which nowadays are not available. You don't see people who are happy in the family.

So no complaints about the husband‚ no complaints about anybody to the husband‚ but you make yourself so sweet that everybody wants to take your guidance‚ your love and they'll come to you. I am sure this you can work it out. There are so many Sahaja Yoginis who have brought such credit to Me and have done such good work. I expect the same from you.

But not to make it serious. It's very important.

So how to handle the men‚ especially your husbands‚ is an art and that art you will achieve gradually when you start seeing.

And she felt insulted.

On the contrary‚ it is invariably done in India‚ invariably. That the woman will always wait till the husband finishes the food‚ because she can look after him better. I mean‚ it's a privilege. It's more matured that you can look after your husband; that you can look after your children. It's your job‚ you are responsible for it. You are the lady of the house‚ you are supposed to do. Like Hema told Me that here nobody asks you for food or anything. Everybody is eating whatever they want to eat. They go and eat any time they want. They will eat any time and they go on eating and eating and eating. Nobody asks that‚ ""You come and have food"" or anything. That's done in India. So she said that ""I waited for a day. Nobody asked me. Then‚ I said I better take something for myself.""

So‚ the ladies have to take up upon themselves that they invite people and cook for them special food. You see‚ this is the job of a woman. She has to develop these qualities‚ the womanly quality of feeding men‚ looking after them when they come to their house. She should not make faces and try to show‚ ""This is my private house. Nobody come in the house."" She should be the one who's welcome more than the husband should. She should be! She should be the one who people should feel closer to‚ like the brothers and sisters of the husband‚ all relations.

So it's such a fun‚ life is. Make it a beautiful life. No use quarreling‚ fighting‚ becoming obstinate. These are not good things. And also it's nice if some husband says that ""Do this.""

""All right‚ I will do it."" Say that. Now you do it yourself‚ you will like it to do something like that‚ no harm‚ or even the leader says you should do something. But if you go on saying no‚ no to everything then he gets fed up with you. And there is no grace.

So why to create problems. Now say‚ supposing somebody puts some paper here‚ all right. Now supposing I put some paper. But supposing My husband doesn't like it. So he will say‚ ""All right‚ please remove this paper."" Now wise woman will say‚ ""All right I will remove it. When should I do it?"" Tomorrow there is a party‚ so you can't remove. All right. Day after tomorrow we are going away‚ so you can't remove. All right we will do it after three days. Within three days the people who come to the party will definitely say‚ ""What a nice paper."" All the ladies will say‚ because it's a ladies' taste. You see men want to make an office‚ you see. So they will come‚ ""What a nice paper‚ what a nice … Then husband will say‚ ""You better keep it this way. It's very nice idea."" That's how they are.

So you understand how‚ you must know how to handle. That's a beauty a woman has‚ she knows how to handle the situation. If she does not know how to handle the situation and then she just starts just jumping at husband‚ jumping at children‚ that shows she is not capable. And the capacity of a woman is how she handles the situation‚ brings the peace in the family‚ how she makes everybody feel comfortable and happy.

They can never give joy. They are themselves not in joy‚ how can they give joy‚ they are themselves not in joy.

So the tension should not be there. At all. Of any kind. Be relaxed. You are the other side of Sahaja Yoga‚ which gives peace‚ joy‚ nourishment and also complete tranquillity. In the family you are responsible for tranquillity. Even if husband is angry‚ children are fighting‚ if the mother is tranquil you can control all the situation.

So the situation has to be controlled in a way that you make life happy for everyone. Sometimes women feel very angry when I tell them that‚ first feed your children‚ your husband‚ and then you eat yourself. Because that is the job of a woman. Like a man should go‚ earn living‚ do what he wants to do‚ job and all that. But the woman has to really look after the husband‚ look after the family‚ look after everything

  Also you will find our Indian husbands not so good‚ as far as gardening is concerned‚ or you can say‚ they don't know how to mend anything like cars or your plumbing‚ they don't know. So doesn't matter‚ take it easy. Gradually they will pick up and they'll learn and they'll do it. But don't become impatient with them. Just make fun of it‚ you see‚ just make fun. That the best way to manage it and that don't expect too much‚ that they will do this nicely. Sometimes they cannot clean the utensils properly‚ they don't know how to do it. So alright. Just make fun of it and just enjoy it because they have to learn.

You see in England or America I have seen anywhere‚ they have no servants at all. While we have servants here. So all these boys are spoiled by the servants. So they are absolutely good for nothing as far as these things are concerned. But if you just try to teach them and help them‚ they will definitely go all out to do it.

So it's only the wife who makes or spoils the marriage. And I have to tell you very frankly that if you still have some doubts about your marriage or if you are still thinking this was not a good match you should withdraw now. And later on you should not go on finding faults with your husband.

See‚ men are men and women are women. Men cannot be women but‚ you can make them understand that women are to be respected. All right‚ and how – that you will have to see by your behaviour.

This is a very big responsibility. In your case it is the preservation of the society that is of Sahaja Yoga people‚ their children. So you have to love all of them. You must care for them.

Never think this is your own house and that you are the queen of the house. But you are the mother‚ you are the sister‚ you are the complete relation of these people who are Sahaja Yogis. So when they come to your house you must show all respect and regard.

Never complain about them to your husband. He won't like it. And also you must remember that your patience and your love and your guidance will definitely help to build your married life.

Even if she has to suffer‚ she can. She is like this Mother Earth. She can suffer anything; She never feels she suffers. She is so great. You are shaktis. So as shaktis if you have to suffer‚ you don't mind. And what you have to feel is that we are responsible for making our Sahaja Yoga society a perfect society. That's our responsibility.

Men‚ you are to be married. You are given full chance to decide whom do you want to marry‚ and after marriage it goes off. Mostly it is the mistake of the women here. I'm very surprised because always it's the woman who dominates. She wants this‚ she wants that‚ like that.

Now‚ you have to know that women are very important for society. Your problem is not so much of political problems or economic problems‚ as such. It is always common like that in every western country‚ but the main problem you are facing is your society. You know what's happening in your society‚ what a terrible society it is‚ how the children are harmed‚ how the women are tortured‚ how so many things are happen ing in our society‚ and all kinds of filthy things are happening which cannot be called as anywhere near advancement. All these things we see around us‚ and we see our children suffer with that.

So what who is responsible for the society? Women. Women are responsible for the society. They have to do it. I'm also a woman and I understand that to Me society is so important. I should not Myself do something that is wrong. I should not allow My children to do something wrong      ",https://www.amruta.org/p/6451,,,,,,,,,,Marriages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If any of you now don't want to marry a particular person‚ you can say no. But now if you are marrying‚ then please think in the way of a Sahaja Yogini who is getting married. The responsibility of bringing a good name to Sahaja Yoga is on you. We are not marrying you because – I mean‚ some sort of a social event. No‚ because you are Sahaja Yoginis‚ because you're sensible women and you'll bring a lot of glory to Sahaja Yoga      ,https://www.amruta.org/p/5073,,,,,,,,,,Marriages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1250,Attachment to your family,,It If you are attached to your family‚ you'll still spoil the relationship," Second thing is‚ you're naturally attached to your parents‚ attached to your family‚ attached to your country. But now‚ forget it! Be attached to your husband's family‚ husband and things around. Because if you are attached to your family‚ you'll still spoil the relationship. I've known many couples being broken because of this. There was a girl who was very much worried about her father‚ because he'd lost the business and she made the whole life miserable. So the husband disappeared and he wanted to do something else and she was left in the lurch and she had to go to her father and then she realized how difficult it is to live in father's house.

So‚ it's your house‚ it's your home‚ it's your husband. All right‚ you don't have to sort of go on searching another person or another woman who will help you. It's you who can help yourself. All right‚ because now we have very bad experiences of some girls who have left their husband and come away to their families with their children. Is the family going to look after them all their lives? Who is going to look after them? So use your brain and don't try to show off that you are something superior or something higher or you're something more. Say something you should be humble. The humbler you are the better it is. Otherwise arrogance doesn't behove you. She doesn't look nice‚ she looks like a horse sometimes and looks like – I don't know like what. So it is better to be humble and to be kind and to be nice and to prove that you are a goodnatured person. All right. ..

1260,Money Orientation,,Not money-oriented‚ but love-oriented," Second thing I have to tell you‚ because you are from the West. So western women are very much money-oriented‚ even Indians have become like that. They want a car‚ they want a house‚ they want this‚ they want that. You shouldn't want anything. You are going to supply to your husband‚ to your family. You don't need anything. That's your beauty‚ that's your decoration that will beautify you. But if you go on hankering after ""I want this‚ I want that"" – there's no end to it. Especially with western mind‚ they are very money-oriented and have created such problems that 1 don't know what to say to them.

So second thing is that you should not be money-oriented‚ but you should be love-oriented. Express your love by different things. By making good food‚ by making a good bed for your husband‚ for organizing the house‚ keeping everything nice. Because if the housewife is untidy the house will remain untidy. It's not the job of the husband to look after the house. You'll enjoy a very beautiful house and a very beautiful room‚ if you keep it properly.

So you should enjoy all that. Enjoy doing everything for the family. Especially for your husband. Little‚ little things can – you see – give him pleasure and happiness. Because he's so tired working in the office. Coming home so tired and then you get after that person‚ is very wrong. So you must change that attitude that we don't want anything. You have everything‚ you are Sahaja Yogis‚ you are absolutely satisfied.

That you will not take; you must keep your self-respect. Don't ask for anything. If he gives you anything well and good. But don't ask‚ don't demand. That means you are not a Sahaja Yogi. If you are a satisfied soul why should you ask for anything? Or somebody gets something‚ she has got this‚ she has … Nothing of that kind.

1290,Indian and western women,,Indian and Western women," So this is what‚ where we lack collectivity. I was saying that all Indians must find out some place where they could go and plant something. Get hold of some sort of a place where they could go and plant some nice banyan trees‚ water it together‚ work it out together. Now the Indian women are that way better. They do lot of work as far as the cooking is concerned and all that‚ but the other part is missing. The other part is intelligence‚ it's the other part is to think. Now if all the time what they are thinking‚ ""Oh‚ my husband likes this‚ I must cook this for him."" And now if the husband has to have a‚ say‚ a lemon with his food – Now‚ there's no lemon in the house. This woman would run up and down all over the place to get the lemon for the husband‚ otherwise he will not eat the food. Doesn't matter‚ once in a while if he doesn't eat it's all right. But the women will try‚ because you see they must keep their – they understand one thing: that you must keep their palate all right. Then they are quite sensible in India because here they're real tigers. All the husbands are like tigers. So you have to keep them feeding. Otherwise you see‚ God knows when the tiger will jump on you.

The other way round in England or America I've seen‚ the husbands are like‚ just like goats and the women are like tigers! And the Westernized Indian women also are like that‚ and when they go to West‚ even simple women I've seen they become like tigresses. Something surprising how they change immediately to the position‚ even if they may not wear the jeans and all those things‚ but they become like that.

So this unbalancing starts in a human being when he doesn't understand that you have to be a axis of the Mother Earth‚ and neither the Capricorn or the Cancer. This balance comes through our depth‚ and that depth has to be improved.

I have seen so many of like that. It has created so many problems. Now I request all the women to behave themselves and understand they are wives. And whatever blessings they have got from Sahaja Yoga will be all withdrawn if you start misbehaving. And all kinds of miseries will be upon them‚ not because of Me but because of Ekadesha Rudra. As you put everything on the bhoots‚ let Me put it on all the deities. I don't take any responsibility. Because if you are irresponsible‚ they'll hit you hard and you will end up with cancer or something very serious and then‚ don't blame me. This is the situation today. I have known some Sahaja Yoginis who confessed to me that they have been doing this‚ they have been doing that. They have been talking about families – this‚ that. And they have been hurt. This is to be understood because I think the women in the West do not have intelligence. They are not intelligent. That's the simple equation I have reached.

So there's all the time the mad race going on between husband and wife. Husband is running after many women and the women are also running after men‚ or they dominate their husband. In this mad race the children are neglected‚ the household is neglected‚ and there's always quarrel going on between the two.

So women should not try to be so subservient about this kind of mad race. They should keep their dignity‚ they should keep their character. They should look after their children‚ not bothering about their husbands. Now the worst thing that is very much accepted is a divorce‚ and so they are afraid that men will divorce them and they'll be left in the lurch.

1370,Respect,,Marriage has to be a special type of a holy alliance,  There's a difference between the other marriages and Sahaja Yoga marriage in which we understand that marriage has to be a special‚ as they call yagnya‚ means a special type of a holy alliance in which you have to lead a very Sahaja life with your wife and to understand her. She is also a Sahaja Yogini. So you must respect her and you must love her‚ and she should really understand that you are her caring‚ loving‚ gentle husband. You must show all concern about her because she is a Sahaja Yogini. She is not an ordinary woman‚ and with that respect I am sure you'll be able to lead a very beautiful Sahaja married life      ,https://www.amruta.org/p/1893,,,,,,,,,,Marriages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1390,Respect,,A man has to respect his wife and his wife should be respectable,"  So then‚ this last‚ Her symbolic hand She says that‚ ""Those who are under your protection‚ you must look after them."" That means you have to bless everyone who comes in contact with you‚ and you have to worry about all the people who are under your control.

So the Lakshmi symbol is not only for the ladies‚ but more for the men. A man who is in business has to respect his wife‚ and his wife should be respectable. If she is not‚ then auspiciousness will not come in that family. So you get all these blessings of Lakshmi if your housewife is good person. This symbol of Lakshmi is expressing a kind of a personality that is expected of a woman or a man who have got the blessings of money. So that is the – I was telling you about the first day what is it‚ second day what is it‚ but main thing is that on a Diwali day we have to worship the Lakshmi.

So today when we are worshipping Lakshmi‚ the men also have to know that they have to have a complete balance in life‚ that they should be generous and look after the people who are under their control     ",https://www.amruta.org/p/41,Diwali,,,,,,,,,Marriages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First thing is that he must see the woman in the household is respected as a Gruha Lakshmi. Then the blessings flow‚ but in no way he should insult her or be unkind to her and raise his voice or say things to her. But the wife has to be the one who is to be respected. Of course. No doubt. She has not to be dominating. She has to remove the dominating forces of others.

She will be your wife. Not because only she is in Sahaja Yoga that you have married her‚ but she's your own. So try to prove it to her that you love her very much and that she is your wife and all that is yours is for her.

1420,Respect,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTL4v865qqw,Respecting the housewife,"""So respecting the housewife is the most important thing in our Sahaj culture. But that doesn't mean that the women should try to dominate and trouble and fight with the husbands. But it means a very important position in the society‚ of a housewife. She is treated as a something like a Devi. But she too has to be a Devi. If you treat her like a doormat‚ then children will never respect her. If you don't pay proper respect to her‚ the children won't respect the mother‚ and there will be no impact of the mother on the children. As a result‚ the children get wayward and‚ in the society or in the countries where the mother is not respected‚ you will find the children become extremely dominating‚ hot tempered and horribly uncollective.

So it's very important that on this day‚ we call it the Dhanteras (the thirteenth day)‚ you have to buy something for your wife‚ and you have to give her something as a present. At least you should buy a little pot‚ or something that can be used in the kitchen to show your respect to her.

In the families where mother is not respected‚ children become extremely troublesome and the whole – their family – also suffers. Wherever they are married‚ whatever happens to them.

Men have to realize it is their mistake that they have never respected their wife as they should have. In the presence of the children if they shout‚ in the presence of the children if they don't show any respect‚ the children can never respect the mother. It is something‚ a criminal thing to do to women who are in the household doing all the work for you‚ looking after you‚ your family‚ not demanding anything.

Only if you want to understand how they can be troublesome‚ is see them in the politics. When they go in the politics‚ they put all men upside-down. And one woman can put all of them in their proper senses. Because their field is their house‚ their family. If they are not respected in the family‚ they get out of the family and behave in such manner that you can't imagine      ",https://www.amruta.org/p/448,,,,,,,,,,Marriages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sometimes they are coming from another country and are of a different culture. So try to understand. This is how you'll understand what is the culture of that country from where she comes. Also it's good for children that you must always respect‚ always respect your wife. You shouldn't have some sort of an ideal about your wife.

If you see somebody doing something wrong‚ suppose if you find that person is trying to do something. All right‚ you just do it yourself or don't tell. Gradually she will learn from you what is the right way is. And one should make fun of these moments‚ for example I don't know how to do any banking‚ write a cheque. I am very bad at many things you see‚ can't even open a television‚ I can't. Even the air conditioner. So many things I just can't do. Doesn't matter. My husband also equally the same.

Who is she to ask me?"" – I don't like women to work; but if they have to work‚ they will work. And if they're working‚ I have told them already‚ that they have to be careful that they are housewives to begin with.

If you think from this angle‚ that the marriage is between two souls who are‚ say‚ left and right and there should be a complete understanding. The emotional part of it – but I find that in the marriages‚ people don't have much understanding about emotional side.

Whatever explanation you may give for that is not good. It's not going to help you. I want to see all of you how you show successfully that you are very nicely married to your wives. But I don't say you spoil them‚ by no means‚ I've already told them. Don't have to spoil them‚ but let them be also on the good lines of Sahaja Yoga. And become good volunteers of Sahaja Yoga.

1490,Advice,,Loving the wife‚ looking after her and the children is very important :,"  So once for all‚ now only you decide that you are marrying – it's a very‚ very big responsibility. We want Sahaja Yoga marriages to be very successful and all of you should enjoy a very happy married life. No use dominating‚ no use controlling‚ but enjoying each other's company. Because your wife is also Sahaja Yogini‚ you are also Sahaja Yogi. And we don't marry you unless and until you are Sahaja Yogis. The reason is we are enlightened people‚ we are of higher awareness. We have our spiritual life. We have to show in our lives how you behave very much differently from others who are stupid people‚ who go on fighting‚ spoiling everything.

So that you will have nice children‚ look after your children‚ look after your family‚ that's your first thing. Of course‚ some of you will be very busy with your work. It's all right‚ but loving the wife‚ looking after her‚ looking after children is very important. Otherwise you should become bachelor‚ you should not marry. But if you are marrying‚ you are taking the responsibility of the wife. She is the daughter of somebody and the father is giving the daughter to you. So‚ so far boys have behaved very well‚ I must say‚ in Sahaja Yoga.

And so now you should also have wisdom and understanding that you are here to produce Sahaja Yogi children‚ to help in Sahaja Yoga‚ because we have to change the world. It's to be emancipated. If you have very lower level of understanding of marriage it won't work out      ",https://www.amruta.org/p/5073,,,,,,,,,,Marriages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1500,Advice,,You have to understand your responsibility :,"  So I've to make a very great respect‚ with great respect I have to make a very humble‚ I should say‚ request to you that – please‚ please – if you are entering into a married life in Sahaja Yoga‚ you have to understand your responsibility. It's a very great responsibility. It's a responsibility for the whole world‚ because we have to change the whole world. And if you behave like other husbands of your country‚ or of other countries‚ then what's the use of marrying in Sahaja Yoga? You can go and have a nice marriage outside. But if you are marrying in Sahaja Yoga you have to know its a big battle against evil‚ against injustice and also against all kind of mismanagement. We want to make a beautiful world and to make a beautiful world we need people who are beautiful‚ who themselves respect everyone.

So‚ I have to make again and again same request to you that you be very good‚ humble and respecting husbands. Don't follow others‚ because I've heard funny things and I was surprised how could these people become like this in marriages in Sahaja Yoga.

Because‚ supposing you are a left-sided person‚ and if you have a person who has a Left side that is very strong‚ it will compensate. And that's how you make a good marriage.

Then I realized that this man has no sense of flowers. He doesn't know what is a rose or what is any other flower. And he might bring something which is horrible‚ you know. Maybe a cactus he might bring. It's better he doesn't bring anything‚ because that would be insulting‚ isn't it? And then one day he admitted‚ ""I don't know about flowers‚ now will you tell me – except for roses‚ I don't know anything.""

So the woman has to listen to man‚ because she preserves her energy much more by that. And there is nothing like domination. Nobody can dominate you. On the contrary there is such domination on the man that he just can't exist without you. He comes back home straight from the work‚ that's how you should control your husband.

Also you shouldn't give her all the time orders – this‚ do this‚ do that – but join hands with her. Because in Sahaja Yoga we don't believe in an individual's rights as to dominate another person.

Later on you tell her that ""It was a mistake and you should not have done it – that's our Mother‚"" and they will respect it. But if you go on shouting‚ you see‚ there will be a gap between them. If you talk to them like that‚ their whole life will change. Be kind to them. Be gentle. Very much‚ it's necessary.

Specially I've seen that in the Western life‚ people have no training how to deal with their wife. There's no arrangement like that – India we have. When they first meet the husband or the wife‚ there's a big ceremony and the gentle way of handling everything      ",https://www.amruta.org/p/6216,,,,,,,,,,Marriages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1730,Gentleness,,You should move slowly‚ gently‚ in a simple manner,  So‚ though the relationship is there‚ you have to establish it. You should move slowly‚ gently‚ in a simple manner‚ not to just to jump on the woman‚ really‚ it's not proper. We've had three‚ four cases like that‚ not many‚ I should say‚ for so many years‚ but still to handle her gently‚ talk to her gently      ,https://www.amruta.org/p/6216,,,,,,,,,,Marriages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1740,Gentleness,,Let them see that you are intellectually higher and very wise,"  I'm very happy to know this. So‚ you have to be wiser and you have to explain to your wife‚ ""See now‚ this is this‚ this is this."" And let them see that you are intellectually higher‚ not only that‚ but you are very wise. Spiritually you understand. And then they will listen to you. Be kind‚ be nice‚ they are leaving their parents‚ they are leaving their families‚ they are leaving their countries also‚ some of them. So be very kind and gentle with them and don't get angry for anything at all. There's no need to get angry at all. All My life I've never been angry.

So that shows unnecessarily people are angry‚ there's no need. Just keep quiet. If you don't like something‚ keep quiet. But don't show your temper or anger. You have to show that you're wise‚ dignified people. I've seen some husbands throwing things‚ shouting‚ doing all kinds of things. Then how can the wife have respect for you unless and until you are respectable? You have to be respectable. You'll be kind to her‚ nice to her. I'm not saying you spoil them‚ not at all. If you think something is wrong‚ then let her sit down‚ you sit down and explain to her that this won't be good from Sahaja Yoga point of view. All right?

1750,Gentleness,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edzuSN9oujk,Shri Rama was a man full of grace,"  And that is what it was here with this rakshasa's sister‚ Shurpanakha. So nowadays‚ if there is a woman in India who behaves like that‚ tries to entice men is called Shurpanakha. So this woman came and tried to entice Shri Rama. Imagine what audacity. So‚ Shri Rama being sankochit- he was a man full of grace. He told her‚ ""See now‚ what's the use of running after Me? I've already got a beautiful wife. So why do you run after Me? Better try My brother who has no wife."" Because He knew that His brother is a Sheshnaga – he is the serpent on which‚ very big serpent called Shesha‚ Shesha. And he is a hot-tempered fellow and he will just know how to deal with this woman and ""I can't manage this show."" Because he would not ill-treat a woman‚ it was too much for Him. Though she was Shurpanakha‚ and not only that‚ but she was also a woman. So He asked her that‚ ""You go and see him."" Lakshmana was sitting outside. Lakshmana had taken a vow to be a brahmachari‚ a celibate man‚ with fourteen years penance- though he was a married man. This he had to do and that's the only way he could kill another demon‚ whose name was Meghnad‚ who had run away with his daughter‚ called as Sulochana. It's a long story. So make it short. This fellow went to this brahmachari‚ Lakshmana‚ who though he had a wife in Ayodhya‚ was leading a life of brahmachari. It is very common in India. I mean‚ if your wife is away‚ you just think about her‚ and you are in separation. Still you enjoy your wife thinking about her. You think about the good things she has done to you. But if she has done all the time bad things‚ you don't want too think about her. And then all these demonic things start. All right. So this‚ when she went and started. She dressed up very well‚ in a very attractive manner‚ tried to show off her body and all that‚ in a very funny way‚ and not in the traditional‚ decent way‚ but a very indecent‚ indecorous manner‚ just to attract. He was so angry with her‚ He just cut her nose. So she should not do this to anybody else and get rid of her pride of nonsense‚ to kill her ego. Because nose is the one that expresses actually the ego part. So when he cut his nose – the nose is called as nasika. In Sanskrit‚ is called as nasika. This was the place where the nose was cut and that's why this place was called as Nasik. So now we have to remember we have come to an area where noses can be cut. So one has to be careful and on the watch out that we do not show any‚ any symptom that Shurpanakha did. Henceforth‚ we should behave in a manner that we are Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginis. And we have to have that right type of conduct which comes from the purity inside      ",https://www.amruta.org/p/6900,,,,,,,Right Heart ,,,Marriages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Shri Rama,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gentleness is very important. How you touch a person‚ how you talk to that person‚ how you look after the respect of the other person‚ and also you see what that person likes. You see‚ as you try to please Me‚ you should try to please each other. It is not very difficult. There is no question of thinking that there is some weakness in me that's why I am pleasing you. No. Sahaja Yogis have to be pleasing people and you have to be extremely gentle‚ especially the first few days. You should try to control yourself a little bit‚ because the first few days I think‚ all the fumes burst out.

1830,Love and appreciation,,Enjoy each other as you are,"  Now the very simple method of enjoying a married life is to know that he is your husband and she is your wife. Now if you consider this is my house‚ this is where I have to live‚ then know that you have to live in this house happily. Not to hanker after somebody else's house. This is the reality‚ that this is my house‚ I have to live here and I have to enjoy it. But if I start seeing other houses I can never be happy. There is no end to it. This is stupidity. What we have‚ you don't want to enjoy and we want to have something else‚ then you can never be happy. Now that's why economic laws work out‚ because they make you feel that you must have more and more and more. But after Sahaja Yoga all these laws should fail‚ only Divine laws should work.

And in married life also‚ if you start seeing at other men or other women that they are better‚ I mean you have your own husband and your wife‚ enjoy among yourselves. It is stupid to try to enjoy somebody else's which is not yours. It's stupid. So make the best of this life by enjoying it. To see to somebody else's wife‚ somebody else's husband and all the time think‚ ""Oh‚ she could have been my wife"" – ""He could have been my husband."" It's nonsense. It's stupidity absolutely. It's like you see somebody's hair. ""I wish her hair were mine."" Why? You see the stupidity. Or ""her nose should be mine."" This is your nose‚ all right? It's as stupid as that.

In the same way‚ your family‚ your household‚ your children are your own‚ your part and parcel. So if they are your part and parcel‚ what is there to grudge and grumble that ""you don't do this‚ you don't drink this‚ you don't do."" What is it? This is my husband as he is. That's all.

They are like that you see‚ very forward time keeping. They hurry up their wives‚ ""Come along‚ how much time you are taking‚ you take always too much time.""

Now men have to work‚ they have no problems‚ they have solved their problems of dress‚ you see‚ it's very simple‚ the tailors have done the job‚ they have a suit; they just put it on and walk out. They don't have to worry about hair‚ they don't have to worry about things. But a woman has to dress up in a proper way‚ she has to find out a proper suit to wear‚ where she's going because she represents the colour and beauty of creation. And the man is very anxious about his‚ say‚ official relationships or whatever it is. Forward‚ all the time shaking hands‚ ""oh sorry‚ sorry‚ thank you‚ thank you."" And a woman is a shy thing you see‚ she's not so anxious to create all these relations‚ so she lags and he pinches her‚ he pushes her‚ he gets at her – it's wrong I think. Normally woman won't understand much of banking‚ not much of banking‚ that's of course after all you see it's quite all right. She doesn't understand of banking it's very good‚ the man can hide the money. He should not.

It's very important‚ if we have to see to Shri Ganesha. Shri Ganesha‚ as you know‚ is on Mooladhara. He controls all our sense as far as the Mooladhara is concerned‚ especially all the excretion. So we are not people who believe in the indulgence of it‚ neither we believe in the detachment of it‚ but in the balance. That's why you all have to be married; you have to have a proper physical life‚ and that you should have proper children and lead a very sensible‚ dignified married life. That is very important. But love should be there. There should be love between husband and wife‚ between children and parents and everyone.

If one person goes into imbalance‚ the whole family goes into imbalance. To establish a family sweetly and nicely is also an art‚ and if both of them agree and say that we will do this way‚ I'm sure it's not difficult‚ because you are Sahaja Yogis‚ you already know the quality of balance. What I find in the West now is the balance has gone really on the rocks; because see now‚ there are all kinds of problems of homosexuality and this and that‚ and all that. This is just because of imbalances; people have gone to that limit. Another is asceticism where your people are ascetic‚ made ascetic‚ like in TM and all that‚ they have taken to these things. Because these are unnatural things. Natural is to be in balance. If you are not in balance then things go off‚ and you become either too much of something and nothing of the other.

It is only when you want to have children actually a human being who is of the highest level will indulge into sex. The lure‚ the romance‚ this nonsense and all that doesn't exist in a pure mind‚ it's all a human creation. And this servility one has‚ that is so much surprising. It comes from a very low grading within us. It comes from the low-graded human beings that one becomes servile to it. You should be the master of that.

And today when I see around Myself‚ in the West‚ which is also part and parcel of the same creation‚ so much of sickness that has come‚ I am really aghast‚ how to turn your attention now to the maturity of sex.

That's one thing one must understand‚ that if the father starts scolding the mother in the presence of the child‚ the child will have no respect for the mother. But the respect must be maintained‚ because if the wife respects the husband‚ then the child will know how to respect her and the husband too.

So the whole thing is built up like that. Is a kind of a pattern for children to follow. One should not try to dominate the husband‚ at least in the presence of children. That's very wrong. Because then the children learn that trick and they start dominating you. So it flows from you to children. So try to see that if you have to do anything then you do it yourself. And respect the husband and in a way that is very obvious to the child that the father is respected by mother. And they are just like monkeys. The way you behave‚ they behave.

Because if they are so bad that you cannot use them. Just like this body‚ if it is so bad‚ it's better to give up and die. So that‚ let that relationship die out. But that death should come to you as a very forceful help; otherwise‚ after that‚ if you become a nervous personality‚ what's the use? So what you have to do after such a thing has happened – that you have given up such a relationship – then‚ if you have to go to courts and all that‚ you should give up Sahaja Yoga for the time being. Solve your problems. Solve your court problems‚ everything‚ then come to Sahaja Yoga. We do not want to get involved into this kind of a thing at all‚ that we have broken any family or anything. If you cannot carry on with a wife‚ not that Sahaja Yoga should be an excuse. Because you cannot carry on with her‚ you should have this thing – go out of Sahaja Yoga‚ do what you like with your wife‚ finish it off once for all. And you should tell her‚ ""I am no more a Sahaja Yogi."" Get it out‚ and then come to Sahaja Yoga.

3000,The need for good upbringing,,Both the things‚ emotion and responsibility‚ have to be integrated:,"  But what I am going to tell you today is a little about the relationship of parents with their children and how it is supposed to be. First of all‚ we develop two kind of relationship with our children‚ in that one is emotional and the other is responsibility . Emotions and responsibility remain two different things. Suppose there is one mother‚ and her child learns or does something wrong‚ still because of emotions she says‚ ""All right let him do it‚ nowadays all children are like this‚ what to say to the child‚ everything is fine."" Another Mother is there who wants to make her children dutiful and responsible. For that she says to her children to get up early in the morning‚ be active‚ study hard‚ go to school in time‚ sit here‚ sit there‚ wear the clothes properly etc. and she is always behind her child to correct him. Now I should tell you that this is not integrated. Today in Sahaja Yoga we have integration. Both the things (emotion and responsibility) have to be integrated. There has to be integration‚ not combination. The difference between combination and integration comes because our emotions should be responsibility and responsibility should be our emotions. Like we love our children. Then we will say that because we love him so it is our duty and responsibility that he should walk on the right path. And he should walk on the right path because we love him. If we don't correct our child or don't tell him the right way to live then it means that we are emotionally dominating.

Then you say: ""What is there in correcting them? Let it be‚ let them do what they want‚ they will be hurt if we correct them or scold them. Why to hurt them? Another person will think: No‚ even if they feel bad or get hurt‚ we have to purify them‚ cleanse them and make them shining.""

Nothing is going to effect by teaching or telling the children. They learn by seeing. They see the behavior of their parents and learn. They see how you behave with others and how you behave with them. How you behave with each other. Children always keep noticing all this .. ..

I've seen a little child saying that – ""Get lost."" I mean it is too much to say to someone. But it happens like that‚ because we do not understand what we should talk before the children‚ how decently. We may be most indecent people‚ doesn't matter.

One should not start demanding what the other side has got.

Like supposing men start saying‚ ""Why not we have children Mother? We should have children‚ why should the women have children?"" That cannot be. And if the women start saying‚ ""Alright‚ we should grow beard."" Supposing tomorrow they might say‚ ""We must have beard and we must have moustaches."" So‚ if such a demand is made‚ that cannot be done. That's not the way. And at human level these are absolutely two separated personalities. At a lower animal stage – see if you go in [sounds like hermaphrodite] [INAUDIBLE] for that stage – then you find that have got both the sexes in them are called as hermaphrodite in their technical language.

But as soon as you start growing up and then the‚ what you say‚ in your evolutionary process as you come up slowly‚ slowly what you find that there are two separate groups are forming up to the human level.

So it is very important that chastity must be respected‚ must be understood‚ and must be imbibed      ,https://www.amruta.org/p/1710,,,,,,,,,,Mend and women,Ganesha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Chastity,,Qualities
5620,Qualities,,Without that holiness (chastity)‚ you cannot work out anything,"  To begin with‚ people laugh at such people. They make fun of them. But holiness is the power within us. As you have heard that Rajput ladies used to sacrifice their bodies so that nobody tries to destroy their holiness‚ their chastity. Because they realized the power that lies behind this chastity. This sense of chastity has helped so many women in this country to lead a very dynamic and a holy life.

It is said that without holiness you cannot work out anything. Even I have heard that in India people believe that if you have to do wrestling‚ the wrestler has to be a holy person. If he is an unholy person‚ ultimately he will fail in life. Even those who play other games have to be holy like Hanumana‚ otherwise they cannot continue with their games and they might develop some sort of problems within themselves.

The warriors who went on the wars and fought other people had to lead a very holy life‚ otherwise they would suffer. As you have seen‚ people coming back from Vietnam have become mad people. In every walk of life holiness was the most important part‚ most important subject that was to be looked after.

No reaction took place to people who fought with Shivaji‚ but when I see the reaction of war in some other countries‚ I'm quite surprised. The reason is‚ while fighting the war‚ they fell into a trap of their ego and did not care for their chastity. Chastity is not only meant for women. That's a very wrong idea; it is very much more for men. Those who lead a chaste life are the people who are glorious.

Maryadas‚ how to talk to someone‚ how to approach someone. While we find people who misbehave‚ even with their husbands‚ with their wives‚ with their children‚ with everyone and also outside they are about to jump on others – that's absolutely against Rama. It's like Ravana. Even Ravana was not like this‚ he was also not of that nature because he had certain dharmas within him. He was a realized soul but he had become a rakshasa because he became arrogant.

But even his arrogance cannot be matched with many modern people and modern girls and men that I hear and see. That it is surprising‚ they have really surpassed Ravana. Ravana only had ten heads but sometimes I feel that the modern men might have‚ or the women specially‚ might have hundred and eight heads. The arrogance‚ the amount of expression of hatred‚ is so ridiculous and makes a person look so useless‚ but I see such people very common and in Sahaja Yoga also they crawl somehow.

So with all that‚ born out of the blessings of the Agni – that is fire – and also was born in the dynasty of Surya‚ He was one of the mildest avatars you have ever had. He's known to be a very – I mean English language – formal person‚ in the sense sankoch – that He would go to any extent to bear upon Himself the problems than to tell others to do something. We still had many people in India like that.

Like we had one prime minister‚ Lal Bahadur Shastri‚ and if he was sitting in the room and there are people sitting and the electricity was on somehow‚ say by light or something‚ and he wants to put it off‚ he would not ask anyone to put it off. Slowly he'll get up from his seat‚ walk up to the switch and just put it off so that he shouldn't ask for anything. This is one of the greatest qualities of Shri Rama‚ that He would not make anyone do anything for Him or order anything‚ or would use someone for that purpose. See‚ He was the blessing of fire and born in the Surya.

You seen now people who try to despise others‚ ""I don't like you – I don't like – it's not good – it's very difficult"" is a sign that such a person is extremely low in character‚ has no character at all but is low in character.

Like He was going by a little boat when He went for His exile. And the one who was taking Him was an ordinary boatman. And the boatman was feeling very much upset that he's sitting before the king of Ayodhya and he doesn't have proper clothes. So Shri Rama‚ who was Himself was wearing nothing but valkalas (simple clothes which are worn by the village people). He had to wear that because His mother‚ the stepmother‚ asked for that kind of boon from the father.

And then Shri Rama just told him‚ ""Why are you worried? I am wearing this. I am no more a king. I am sitting before you like this. You should be quite comforted . And I really don't know how to steer the boat while you know how to steer the boat‚ so why should you be worried?""

The person like Shri Rama was a very healthy‚ tall person with his hands up to the knees – ajanabhav.

And He was plump‚ both of them were plump. They had to be plump people‚ because though they were born of the Agni – He was born of the Agni‚ but the water is the main element of Shri Vishnu. So they were all plump people‚ they were not thin like sticks as today's modern ideas are‚ to be thin like sticks and like TB-patients.

But it doesn't mean all plump people are good. We always logically think that plump people are‚ if Mother says so‚ then plump people are good. Is not the point. The inner side of it I am saying‚ the inner side of it is just the opposite. Inner side of it is absolutely beautiful and absolutely full of love‚ affection and warmth.

Now‚ when it went ahead with it in His character‚ which was so beautiful‚ that you find He was such a consistent person. Whatever He said‚ all the life He carried that. For example‚ He said‚ ""I am the one who believes in one wife – aika patni vrat.""

Now He had a very nice wife‚ no doubt‚ very beautiful wife‚ but She had gone to Ravana and He was left alone.

He said‚ ""No‚ I can't marry because nobody could be like My wife and I can't marry. I can forego this kind of a yAgnya but I can't marry again.""

So‚ then they said‚ ""All right‚ there's only one thing you can do is to make a statue of Sita in gold and you have to use Her‚ that statue‚ as a wife representing.""

""We don't know‚ Mother. We didn't see. We didn't bother."" There should be alertness as to how much money is going where‚ where it is spent‚ how much you have got‚ this thing. You go to an ashram‚ you ask them‚ ""Now‚ how much money you have got?"" In short‚ you don't know how much money you have got. ""No‚ Mother‚ You know we went to that place‚ and then we bought twenty tins of fish‚ so all money was exhausted.""

""But why? Why did you buy twenty tins of fish?"" ""Because the women said 'You'd better buy twenty fish.'"" ""How many there are to eat?""

Like that‚ they have no idea‚ no alertness‚ nothing‚ it's all a mess. What time people get up‚ what time they sleep‚ what time‚ what they do; there is no alertness about it‚ because in Sahaja Yoga you are your own guru. Everybody's guru. A great guru they are!

You are your own guru no doubt‚ but you must have that self- discipline. To be a guru you have to be self-disciplined and a determination‚ complete determination to rise higher‚ to ascend by whatever means possible‚ whatever is needed for your ascent. That is a sign of a person who will be a guru.

There's no communication. There's a communication gap. There's no understanding of each other. There are problems. There's no emotional attachment to anyone. That's not an ashram      ",https://www.amruta.org/p/6592,,,,,,,,,,Mend and women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6010,Alertness,,So that alertness should be there,"  Unless and until you realize this‚ the alertness about it‚ our ashrams are just like orphanages. People like a leader to be sweet‚ sweetie-pie‚ so that they can eat very well. Or somebody overly strict comes in. He's another Hitler. There's no discretion that you have to be strict‚ at the same time you have to be loving‚ caring‚ protecting.

Many things can be said in humour. That doesn't give such a sting to people. But a Sahaja Yogi should think‚ highly honoured that Mother is saying something to him‚ that you have to do this or do that‚ that She's so much bothered about you‚ about your family‚ about your children‚ about your ashram.

So that alertness should be also in the minds of the men of the ashram: how to behave‚ how to talk‚ what to say. You are the mouthpieces of God Almighty. How can you waste your time chatting? So it is to be realized how to behave‚ for a person who is the mouthpiece of God. You represent Him‚ actually. How you should dress up‚ how you should walk‚ how you should sit‚ how you should eat. '

I was surprised that people are drinking beer in the ashram. I mean‚ it is non-alcoholic. But it's beer‚ made of molasses. But‚ anyway‚ it is beer. How can you drink that molasses business? Have you ever been near any sugar factory? The smell of the molasses! You are consuming that!

So whatever you are eating‚ whatever you are spending‚ whatever you are talking‚ I mean whatever is the extroversion‚ whatever is outside‚ must express your inside      ",https://www.amruta.org/p/6592,,,,,,,,,,Mend and women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6020,Being competent,,You have to be first class‚ never justify your inefficiency‚ inadequacy or incompetence," So‚ we come to the point that we have to be active. We have to be active producing more wealth. You see‚ not like taking out the wealth from here‚ putting to something else but we should produce more wealth. Now‚ how do you produce more wealth? We should see that. By changing forms‚ by anything‚ we should get to it‚ that we should produce more wealth.

For example‚ if Sahaja Yogis think that ""All right‚ I'm not going to work and I'm going to sit at home and I'm just going to be a sort of a dishwasher."" That's not the way.

Sahaja Yogis have not only to work‚ but work according to their deserving. Apart from that‚ they should improve. Like you see somebody‚ ""Oh I'm all right‚ I can paint a little bit but if it is comes to something better painting then I think I'll have to get somebody else.""

That means at least you don't know even painting. You have to‚ in activity‚ you must know that you must perfect that profession. All the Sahaja Yogis must have a profession which is perfected. It's not like this that ""I'm just a waster."" All right‚ accept the situation‚ ""I'm a waster‚ sitting like a waster and doing no activity."" Only‚ then the problems like the ones we had come up that you start earning money out of women‚ or do sort of useless things like swindling and telling stories‚ taking out money. So wasters are not allowed in Sahaja Yoga. Anybody who tries to be a waster will be thrown out. Never justify your inefficiency‚ inadequacy or incompetence. You have to be first class‚ competent people in every respect. There should be no diffidence in you. If there is diffidence you are no good for Sahaja Yoga. So‚ not that you should get after the money but Raja Lakshmi. Means‚ there should be complete activity of your complete manifestation of all your qualities.

Try to improve‚ try to improve! That doesn't mean that you run a rat race‚ like a mad cap‚ nothing of Sahaja Yoga. Not that! It doesn't mean that. I have to warn you there. But you should not be just a waster‚ you see‚ that you don't have to pounce here and like a beggar you are moving about. This is not proper. Try to improve your conditions‚ try to improve your techniques‚ try to improve your competence and understanding of the whole subject. Whatever you take up‚ take up this or that. Get into it and work it out‚ sort it out. You should become … you can do it with Sahaja Yoga.

This is one of the big problems we have of Sahaja Yogis‚ do you know this? One of the biggest problems! Because nobody is impressed by you‚ nobody is impressed. They think some loonies have gathered around Me. Nobody is impressed. Everybody looks like a confused personality‚ you see‚ walking like this. They th ink that Mother must have mesmerized them and they are all moving like a wave to this and that.

So‚ today on a Diwali day we have to say that we will become more competent‚ experts in whatever we are doing. We have to be! We have to be people with impressions. Now‚ what impresses people in this world? Only two things. Either … in the beginning‚ in superficiality‚ only two things can impress in superficiality. Because firstly they are superficial. When they will see us‚ they'll see our first impression. First‚ they will see what are you. I mean‚ if you look like a drunkard‚ nobody is going to come. If you look like a hippie‚ nobody is going to come. Nobody has any faith in hippies‚ I must tell you very frankly‚ anymore      ",https://www.amruta.org/p/6739,,,,,,,,,,Mend and women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We must have proper qualifications. If possible‚ better to get some qualifications. You are all very intelligent people and you can get your qualifications. You should have a respectability in the society. Otherwise they'll think that this Mother is the Mother of all the beggars.

So steady yourself‚ in your jobs‚ in your houses. To steady yourself you must learn not to change. The change makes you unsteady. Do you see the point? So there is no question of changing. ""I'm going to go through it."" Then if it is necessary‚ if it is not workable‚ then one can change. It applies to everything

6040,Being competent,,You must impress others with your example,"  Now‚ people when they speak‚ either they cannot impress or they go on like mad‚ they put on their heads and say something. That's not the way. You must practice it. Go to the sea‚ go anywhere in the open‚ say loudly. You can go‚ say for example‚ to this Hyde Park and say loudly what you have say. Say it loud‚ practice it. Say how you say. Practice it. Overcome your defects. Do not enjoy your defects‚ it's not the way. Now‚ no more time left for that kind of a thing. Because‚ you see‚ there's no impression of people on others. They are not impressed by you. You see with Me whatever is impressed is all right. But you have to become the gurus‚ you have to become the leaders. And‚ the impression should be on people that you are people who are smart at it‚ you know the job‚ you know how to speak‚ how to present sahaja Yoga and do it in a way that's congenial‚ loving‚ affectionate and not like a volcanic stuff also. Sometimes‚ you see‚ people get very volcanic with others. That also! With complete poise and self-control‚ self-control.

This is only achieved through self-discipline. You must discipline yourself and do not waste yourself‚ must have self-esteem. This is one of the biggest lackings in Sahaja Yoga today. There's no impression on people. And‚ this is what one has to do in your dressing up‚ how you talk to people‚ how you behave – that's very important in the outside. But inside if there's all the time you harp upon it‚ ""Oh‚ I can't do it. This is not for me. This much I can do."" Then you have not been kind to yourself and to anyone.

6050,Being competent,,Self-control in your behaviour, So‚ for your Raja Lakshmi‚ for your Gruha Lakshmi it is important that you should have self-control in your behaviour‚ how you talk. When you talk‚ if you talk like a cheap person or like a person who is dosed with something then nobody is going to be impressed. How you behave is very important. How you sit‚ how you talk      ,https://www.amruta.org/p/6739,,,,,,,,,,Mend and women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6060,Being competent,,We must know how much control we have upon ourselves,"  That is very important. For example‚ some people have no proper image and they try to influence others‚ so it's a mockery. Nobody gets influenced by such a person who himself has no image of his own. So before working out the exterior‚ the interior must be worked out.

For example‚ a person who always comes late to the office‚ and is always delayed‚ has no time-sense‚ is never respected. So when you tell people that they should be on time‚ you should be the first to arrive at the right time. You must always keep the time‚ absolutely. You should be known for keeping time. So if you have to go to the office at ten o'clock‚ you reach the office in such a way that you are there five minutes too early‚ wait outside end enter the office at the time when you have to go there.

That punctuality is very important. That helps people and people get an awe for you. They think‚ ""this gentleman is so regular and I'm the one who is absolutely late."" Also‚ if you tell somebody that ""I have to meet at such and such a time‚"" and ""this should be arranged at such and such a time‚"" then you should be absolutely punctual. It's very important that the punctuality is to be maintained by you      ",https://www.amruta.org/p/1206,,,,,,,,,,Mend and women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6070,Being competent,,You cannot influence people at all if you are yourself a lazy person,"  Now I've seen‚ in the West especially‚ that people get up very late‚ are very lazy. They walk in a lumpy manner and the whole thing shows that they are not interested in the world. They are just pushed into it‚ and somehow or other they are doing. Such a person can never influence anyone‚ because people also see your image‚ that you yourself are dragging your life somehow. So why to do the same thing‚ whatever he is doing. He cannot tell us anything. So that is another reason why you cannot influence people at all‚ if you are yourself a lazy person.

So‚ the person who has to influence others must be an early riser‚ must have proper habits of sleeping‚ must get up in the morning and be properly brushed‚ washed end everything‚ and should be what we call a smart man      ",https://www.amruta.org/p/1206,,,,,,,,,,Mend and women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6080,Being competent,,Your self-confidence must be shown through all your behaviour‚ like talking‚ walking‚ sitting and communicating,"  It is very important that‚ when you are talking to people‚ you should have a proper style of talking‚ walking. A proper style. This should all be trimmed down properly‚ that you don't walk in a languid manner‚ in a manner of throwing your legs here and there‚ but straight‚ and sit down straight. And let people see that you have faith in yourself first of all. If you don't have faith in yourself … I mean‚ any behaviour that shows that you have no faith in yourself – you cannot influence others.

So your self-confidence must be shown through all your behaviour‚ like talking‚ walking‚ sitting and communicating. There should be a feeling of confidence. But the confidence comes with a person when he realises that he is completely secure. And in Sahaja Yoga you know that if your centre heart is secure‚ tell yourself‚ ""Mother is with me. Mother is helping me‚ and I'm with Mother. I have nothing to worry."" Then your centre heart will be alright. Of course‚ this you cannot tell to others. But still‚ if you have personality‚ you can imbibe that into others very simply.

But if you are diffident about yourself then you cannot do it. So confidence is to be established first of all within yourself. For Sahaja Yogis it's very easy to say‚ ""I am the spirit‚ and I am the child. I am the one who has been chosen by the Adi Shakti Herself."" So there should be a tremendous amount of confidence in you      ",https://www.amruta.org/p/1206,,,,,,,,,,Mend and women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6090,Being competent,,All these things are watched by others. How you eat. How you talk,"  For example‚ when you are with people‚ how do you eat your food? Some people open their mouth all the time‚ eat their food with a sort of a sound. All these things are watched by others. How you eat. How you talk. Normally you should not keep your mouth open. You can never influence people. Keep your mouth – not pursed either‚ but in a normal way – closed so that people don't think that you are just gaping at them if you keep your mouth open all the time.

Or they should not think that you are aggressive with them or angry. But have a normal face‚ a face that is neither aggressive nor it is subservient. Suppose if you keep a gaping mouth‚ they'll think‚ ""Oh‚ he's an idiot."" And if you purse your lips they'll think you are a person of an aggressive nature. So one has to understand how you are sitting before others‚ talking to others. And to influence others‚ first of all‚ as I said‚ you must respect your own personality‚ and then respect the personality of other people in your behaviour      ",https://www.amruta.org/p/1206,,,,,,,,,,Mend and women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If there is spirit in me‚ there is spirit in him also. So you must see that he sits properly‚ that he is comfortable‚ and ask him if he wants any tea. Make him comfortable. Make him feel that you are not in any way disturbed‚ nor that you are irritated‚ but you are very happy to meet him and you should settle down with kindness.

Sometimes also in diffidence one might feel nervous about a person. That nervousness is a sign of insecurity. One should not be nervous if one is talking to someone. One should be in a way that another person should feel absolutely confident and should feel that this gentleman is very pleasant      ",https://www.amruta.org/p/1206,,,,,,,,,,Mend and women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But on the contrary‚ you see what they say. You can watch me‚ I do that many times. When somebody says something‚ ""Oh‚ that is true‚ but you see‚ this is it     So they don't mind. They think that you have seen the other side of the thing also‚ that you have a balance‚ you don't just impress your idea upon others.

But when you are dealing with others‚ like somebody is there sitting – if you want to put on the light‚ slowly‚ while talking‚ you get up and put on the light.

6130,Being competent,,Now the dress also‚ I'd say dress is very important in influencing others,"  Now supposing you are connected with somebody in an official way‚ or in any way that you want to influence him in the business and all that. The best thing is to wear business dress‚ not dress that is relaxed or casual. You must wear a dress that is a business dress‚ like a deep blue suit with a lot of stripes‚ a proper three-piece smart thing‚ and smart‚ clean shoes‚ and the hair nicely done‚ maybe a little bit oiled‚ it's alright. Look like a smart business person.

But if you try to do the fashions of the world‚ you see‚ then it changes everyday. Today the hair will be this side‚ tomorrow that side. So make the hair style as an official would do‚ that is to properly comb it. In the olden days‚ if you see‚ even the heroes of the film used to have oil in their hair. They never had this kind of hair that is dry. I mean‚ it need not be oil‚ but should be properly groomed as they say. There are lots of things available in the market which can just groom your hair without oiling it. It should be properly groomed hair so that it shows that you have paid attention to your appearance and hairstyle. So you make an image out of yourself that is absolutely suitable for a particular type of a job.

Now‚ for example‚ if a cook appears in a swimming suit‚ what would you think of that? It's horrid! A cook has to dress up like a cook. In the same way‚ a businessman also has to dress up like a businessman. You cannot go about in jeans in your office. Because‚ if you do it‚ everybody will do it.

Because Kalpana was to be born and I was knitting outside. And a lady came to Me and she said‚ ""We are refugees‚ we have no place to go. And will You be able to give me some place in Your house?""

I said‚ ""All right."" It was a huge house of My father. I said‚ ""It is such a big house. And we have a space outside which you can use and also you can have a kitchen there and a bathroom. You can stay there.""

She said‚ ""We have a friend and my husband. Can we stay here?"" I said‚ ""That's all right.""

So we arranged for their stay there. And it so happened that people in My family didn't like it very much. Especially My brother‚ you see‚ My husband told him that‚ ""I wouldn't like this lady to be here. God knows what sort of a lady she is.""

And My brother said‚ ""Now‚ if She has said it‚ if my sister has said it‚ I can't say anything; but She is the one who has to decide about this house. So it is Her job to decide. So I can't say anything."" So‚ they all kept quiet about it. And‚ they stayed over.

And this man‚ her husband's friend‚ was a Muslim. And there was a big riot in Delhi. Very big riot! And so many Hindus‚ you see‚ like these Jansanghis and fundamentalists – they had formed a horrible group which was killing many Muslims also. So‚ from the servants and all that they must have known that there is a Muslim staying in this house‚ you see. So‚ they came to My house‚ about five‚ six of them with clubs and this and that. So these people got frightened.

So I told this Muslim‚ I said‚ ""You go and hide in My room. I'll go and face them."" I went outside.

So they said‚ ""We've heard that there is a Muslim in Your house.""

6270,Role model of great women,,When she is there‚ only thing they can feel her fragrance like a lotus,"  That Lakshmi has got four hands and She stands on a lotus. And She is a body with a – which is I mean‚ not a slim type of a body. But She has a substantial body. But She stands on a lotus. Means‚ wherever She lives‚ you see‚ She doesn't show Her presence by staying. She is so‚ so beautiful that She adjusts Herself even on a lotus. She doesn't exert Her weight like cheap women do. Anywhere they go they'll say‚ ""Oh‚ I don't like this and I like that. And I would like to have this. And‚ I would like to sleep in a place like this. And I like this type of thing.""

So the first quality of a woman with the Lakshmi is adjustment. No one feels her. When she is there‚ nobody feels. Only thing they can feel her fragrance like a lotus. I mean‚ that's the sign of a woman who adjusts herself. She is not bothered about her own life‚ but she's bothered about others     ",https://www.amruta.org/p/6739,,,,,,,,,,Mend and women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6280,Role model of great women,,She gives and protects,"  So then the seeking moves toward the deeper seeking. So the same Lakshmi becomes Mahalakshmi. When you start expanding yourself to higher and deeper valuables then this Lakshmi doesn't lure you much; She's just there for your glory‚ but not for your satisfaction. The wealth is there for distribution. You enjoy the – there's no word for dhan‚ I think? Oh generosity – but generosity is different. But what I'm saying‚ generous fondness – it's a fondness you see‚ that you should be generous. That is a very great happiness and joy that you feel. That is the greatest‚ when you are generous‚ when you give away. That's a fondness‚ that's a kind of a human expression of one's own being‚ that you want to be generous. And this generosity only can come when Mahalakshmi principle is born in you. But at Lakshmi principle also She stands like this; Her hand is like this (giving) another is like this (protecting).

So miserliness is not a sign of wealth. I mean‚ if you are miserly that means you are not generous. If you are really wealthy why will you be miserly? It's a simple equation‚ that means if you are really wealthy‚ you will just give away. If you cannot give away‚ then you are poor‚ you are a beggar. You are still hankering after that. That means you are still a beggar‚ you are hankering.

So this left hand‚ She is giving all the time‚ and with the right hand‚ She protects‚ see. She gives protection to people. The wealth must give protection to people‚ in the way it must look after the well-being of others‚ not your own self-indulgence; like having all the best things to yourself while others are starving. That's not a sign of a wealthy man. A wealthy man is a person who knows that unless and until he shares his things with others‚ he is not going to be happy      ",https://www.amruta.org/p/6789,,,,,,,,,,Mend and women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But the value system for a divine person is not based on the amount of money or amount of matter it has‚ but it depends on what vibrations. So the whole evaluation system changes when you get into divine temperament‚ that you start seeing things – what is precious is what has the maximum vibrations. Whatever has vibrations is the precious thing for a realized soul. And not what is not divine. What is not divine‚ we have nothing.

6310,Role model of great women,,Shri Lakshmi is the symbol of the completeness of womanhood,"  So I'll try to tell you about the Lakshmi‚ the symbol of Lakshmi. Shri Lakshmi is the symbol of the completeness of womanhood. She brings wealth‚ prosperity‚ auspiciousness. She brings in understanding‚ generosity‚ peace and joy. She is the giver of all the blessings. The symbol of Lakshmi is that She stands on the lotus which is pink in colour. Pink colour is the warmth of motherhood. In

India even a small girl is called as mother. So in the various aspects of Lakshmi‚ the symbol is that first She is a very warm person. Also in one hand She has the lotus which is pink in colour that also is suggestive of Her warmth. Even a funny type of a moth with all kinds of thorns attached to his body enters into a lotus‚ he finds a place where he can rest. She makes all the guests to come in her house and have the best bed and the best food. Normally the men bring in a guest and the wife receives him and looks after him. So it is suggestive that we have to look after any type of a guest who comes to our house‚ and should completely devote ourselves to the looking after of the guest who is from outside.

She is standing on the lotus and wearing also a pink sari. That is‚ you have to have balance to stand on a thing like lotus because She is surrounded by water‚ and there are many animals around‚ beast-like people who try to entice Her‚ so She has to have a complete balance. Also She has two hands with the lotus and with two other hands She is giving‚ and with another hand She is blessing. This one means that she should be generous‚ she should be giving always to others‚ not for herself. She should not spend all the money on herself and nothing for the children or for the guests or for others. So it is the Lakshmi who has to give‚ who has to be generous      ",https://www.amruta.org/p/41,,,,,,,,,,Mend and women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6320,Role model of great women,,So with your Lakshmi awakened‚ why should you worry about money?,"  This is how it is‚ always. Everything comes back to you when you are kind to others‚ or if you are generous to others. You will find later on yourself‚ and so many have already found that just money flows to them. They can't understand from where the money is coming. Just it works out that you get money‚ whenever you want. You should not worry about money. Just forget it and it comes to you.

People who are all meticulously counting their money all the time‚ every morning‚ are never satisfied and also they haven't got the blessings of any kind. But if you'll just keep the worry of money to God‚ everything works out. So what do we understand? That it is all in

the hands of God Almighty. After coming to Sahaja Yoga you don't have to worry about anything. Leave it in the hands of God and everything will work out. There is no need for you to go on telling people that ""Oh‚ I am so much worried‚ I have no money‚ I have no money!"" That shows that you are not yet Sahaja Yogis. So if you have to improve those who are your neighbours or your friends or your country‚ first of all you have to be very mature Sahaja Yoginis. So the Lakshmi is already awakened within you. She resides in your Nabhi Chakra. So with your Lakshmi awakened‚ why should you worry about money?      ",https://www.amruta.org/p/41,,,,,,,Nabhi,,,Mend and women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6330,Role model of great women,,A guest should be treated just like God,"  So the last day they worship the Goddess Lakshmi because it is Her blessings that brought forth all these beautiful meetings. And that's why they worship Her – Lakshmi – as such. But there are nine types of Lakshmis within us‚ which I think I have told you sometime back.

Now in that Lakshmi Puja is this that you worship the Lakshmi herself. It doesn't mean money – not at all. To worship money is wrong. But what it means that Lakshmi is the money which is with us‚ or whatever prosperity with Her should be very carefully spent because She is very mobile and the money can slip out. On the contrary you should not be at all miserly. Miserly people – Lakshmi is not happy. But if you want to spend‚ you must spend it in the right way otherwise the money is spent in the wrong way.

Now when the Lakshmi was created – must be knowing‚ out of the churning of the sea She came out – She had four hands. One hand was to give. She is generous‚ She gives. Like this She gives. And with one hand She blesses. These are Her two hands. One is to give and to bless the person. Very important it is that when you give to somebody something‚ you forget about it and you bless that person. Not only you give money‚ but also you bless that person.

The other two hands have got two lotuses of pink colour. Pink is the colour of love and a person who has money should have a house which is full of love. Any guest who comes in the house should be respected . He should be treated just like God. In India you have noticed how they think foreigners – foreigners means God to them. Here foreigner is a bad word‚ but in India is very respectable. If you are a foreigner means you are God. How they have looked after you‚ you know that – in India. This is the reason. This is the basic culture of India. That anybody who is a guest‚ he may be anything‚ if he is a guest then he is to be treated like God. In the other countries it's just the other way round you know. If you are a foreigner then people think it's not even proper to talk to that person. I don't know how the mentality is like that – but not in Sahaj Yoga. Sahaja Yogis are not like that. They treat the guests very well‚ I have heard. They look after each other and they are beautifully collective. So this is what is the meaning of the lotus – is a house full of love. Like a beetle‚ which has got even thorns‚ when it comes to the lotus‚ the lotus open out and the beetle goes inside and sleeps very nicely and comfortably – even the beetle‚ undisturbed     ",https://www.amruta.org/p/448,,,,,,,,,,Mend and women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6340,Role model of great women,,She comes out of the sea‚ becomes a Raja Lakshmi and a Gruha," So She has arisen out of the sea‚ so She is Miriam you can call Her. She is Marie‚ She is Marie. That's why Christ's Mother's name was Mary because She came out of the sea. People‚ I don't know if they think about it – why She was called Mary of all the things. Why this name Mary? Now‚ this power which came out of the sea‚ because the whole thing‚ the seeking started in the sea first of all as you know. It had to be in the sea because first the animals were born in the sea only. Becomes‚ when She comes out of the sea‚ becomes a Raja Lakshmi and a Gruha Lakshmi.

Raj Lakshmi is the one where collectively‚ collectively you enjoy your well being‚ Collectively on the right hand side‚ you can say. Like‚ we have some places which are for public usage here‚ public well-being. And Gruha Lakshmi is the one which is for the individual‚ individual well-being.

So‚ we have the essence of Lakshmi and then we have‚ when we evolved we started having our homes‚ houses‚ our own family‚ our own private life‚ our this thing. So‚ we had Gruha Lakshmi. And then we started having collective‚ like we can say the Queen represents here Raja Lakshmi. The queen represents here Raja Lakshmi of England. She is a symbol of that. Our queen here is the symbol of that Raja Lakshmi. You know‚ the word Raj means the kingdom or you can say the royal‚ royal side of the regality. So‚ when the Lakshmi is a regal Lakshmi‚ She is for collectivity. So the queen doesn't live for herself‚ she lives for all the collective being. In the same way‚ the Raj Lakshmi is the One that is for all of us .

6510,Role model of great women,,Padmini,"  There is a story I must tell you‚ very interesting about a very beautiful woman called Padmini. She was the wife of a king. And there was a horrible Muslim king who wanted to see this woman because he heard she was very beautiful. See‚ this was a funny thing. And she came‚ and he came to that kingdom and he said that ""I must look at this lady‚ otherwise I'll destroy the whole kingdom."" Now‚ people said ""This can't do‚ she's our queen. She can't‚ you can't see our queen like that.""

She just thought ""All right. He need not see me‚ but he might see my reflection."" So she stood before a mirror and he saw her reflection.

Then he became even more mad and he said that ""I must have this woman. If you don't give her to me‚ then I'll destroy all of you."" Imagine a king doing all these nonsense for a woman. Shows what a useless fellow he was. So he brought all his army‚ everything and settled down near the fort where these people were and sent a message that ""If you don't send this lady to me‚ then I'm going to attack.""

They were not prepared‚ they didn't know what to do‚ so they said that ""Let us go and fight him. We cannot allow our queen to be given to him. It's a question of prestige."" They took a hundred palanquins. You understand palanquin? They took hundred palanquins and in those hundred palanquins there were four warriors sitting with these arms and everything. And there were two who were carrying them. And they said: ""All right. The queen is coming with her hundred maids."" The Muslims that time they were – the Muslim king was‚ I mean‚ he's drank something-very happy that the queen was to come. So these people went there and came out of their palanquins and started fighting. They had told these women that ""In case we win‚ by five o'clock in the morning we'll light a fire and when you'll see the fire then you know that we have won the race. But if we do not win‚ then you should know for definite that we have not won the battle.""

They were only‚ say‚ four hundred people or six hundred people‚ and thousands were with this man and he had guns‚ and guns and everything. So they started fighting. In that fight that Muslim king won because he had so much of power. And most of these people died. Even the king was killed. There was no fire lit at five o'clock so these women saw there was no fire lit. So they made a huge big platform of pyre and came down to the pyre and lit the fire and they all died. Three thousand women died because they didn't want other men to touch them.

But some of the ladies can be very much like a Hitler‚ you know‚ in the household – very dictating. ""This should be like this‚ that should be like that."" Making the life of men absolutely miserable. I have known a person who used to carry a newspaper in his house. So I said‚ ""Why do you carry it all the time?"" So he said‚ ""Whenever I sit‚ I put the newspaper first and then I sit.""

""Why?""

""Because‚ if it is spoilt a little bit my wife will shout at me."" I said‚ ""Why?""

""Because she doesn't like anything to be spoilt. So she is so particular‚ I carry a newspaper always with me. Wherever I have to sit‚ I put a newspaper.""

I said‚ ""It's too much.""

He said‚ ""You will also have to do that‚ I tell You.""

So very particular about the whole house that it is impossible to live in that house – is even worse than a hospital. So some women can be very particular about that and very methodical – could be. But normally women should be very loving and extremely accommodating‚ and also being friendly with all the family members‚ with everyone.

That is what is‚ what we call auspiciousness – one of the great qualities of the Lakshmi is. That it should be auspicious. Whatever you give should be auspicious. Like‚ sometimes I have seen‚ little children out of mischief will bring a lizard and try to give you. It is very inauspicious to do that. But they are not told it is inauspicious so they are doing like that. They have to be told it is not auspicious; it will not please the Goddess.

Towards yourself the greatest generosity is that you do not bear any malice or bitterness about anyone. But clear-cut ideas that ""He's like this and he's like this.""

Forgiveness gives you a big kavacha – it's a big band han‚ a big protection‚ you can say shield – from all kinds of evil that others can put on you. Just forgive them‚ and then you see what happens to them. You just try this trick: just forgive‚ and see what happens to others who try to torture you. Of course‚ Divine never wants to torture anyone – that is definite. It never wants to torture; It is extremely generous‚ It likes to forgive. It enjoys Its forgiveness‚ It really enjoys.

Immorality‚ corruption and violence are the two horrible monsters which are eating up our society. I would blame the mothers of these corrupt and immoral persons because they failed in their duty as mothers in their childhood. The loving training of the mother is the first and most effective influence in shaping the children into beautiful citizens. Mothers who never tried to guide with great concern and love‚ or the wives or the daughters who are falling into the fear of the men or of the destructive culture‚ have not done their duty as integral members of the family to strengthen the moral fibre of the men      ,https://www.amruta.org/p/6378,,,,,,,,,,Mend and women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An eighty-year-old women also would like to look like a bride. They do not feel their dignity and enjoy their dignity within themselves: they are the queen of the house. But they want to behave like cheapish‚ childish‚ young‚ frivolous girls. They don't feel the dignity of their being. They talk too much‚ they behave in a manner that doesn't behove a housewife‚ like they'll take out their hands‚ talk like this as the fisher-women do when they sell their fish to someone and when they have to fight.

Or they shout sometimes‚ they shout‚ also I mean‚ this … I've heard they shout and sometimes they beat their husbands‚ that's the limit. They start always comparing themselves with the husband‚ to begin with. Like‚ ""I am such a rich man‚ a rich man's daughter. I am from such and such family‚ my husband is from such a low family. He has no money‚ nothing. He is not educated."" So ill-treat him‚ treat him in a manner that shows no respect.

Such a woman will lose all her powers. Also in her own ways she will feel guilty‚ she will feel guilty because first of all nobody has the right to look down upon anyone whatsoever‚ in Sahaja Yoga especially. Then to look down upon your husband is something unbelievable. He may not be a Sahaja Yogi. .. all right. He may not be up to the point.

Because if you put like that hair‚ your eyes can become squinty. But that's the fashion‚ to put the hair like this you see‚ very much sometimes on the eyes also. So that's a jibreya fashion.

7660,The importance of alertness,,So that alertness has to be there in a housewife.,"  Gruha Lakshmi is the woman who should know that she has the great responsibility of creating a very great society of Sahaja Yoga. She's not an ordinary woman. How many women got their realization before? But in Sahaja Yoga if you find the ladies‚ you hardly find very few who are really alert. Most of them are in trance condition. They don't know anything. They don't know anything. They don't know much of cooking‚ you ask them anything‚ they don't know anything. You talk to them‚ you feel as if they have taken some sort of a drug. Nothing goes into their heads. Sometimes one feels‚ ""It's better I do it myself."" Impossible.

The alertness is gone‚ because alertness that comes through your Right side is wasted on nonsensical things. Attention is wasted on nonsensical things‚ that's why the housewives have lost that discretion to know that they have to be extremely alert and sensible and wise. They should know each and everything. It's not so. They just live in the air‚ somewhere hanging‚ you know. You don't know what to say to them‚ how to ask for anything. How to explain anything to them is an impossible situation. So that alertness has to be there in a housewife. It's extremely important. ..

7670,The importance of alertness,,Sahaja Yoga is meant for women who are alert‚ who are wise," But if you do not have the alertness‚ then you cannot be a Gruha Lakshmi‚ you cannot be a good mother‚ you cannot be a good wife. There's no slavery in it. They don't know even what pleases their husbands‚ how to create peace in the family‚ what to say‚ when to say beautiful things and when to be strict. All this discretion is not there. Either they are shrews or they are slaves.

So Sahaja Yoga is meant for women who are alert‚ who are wise‚ who know everything about life. Even they don't know where are the chakras on the feet. Look at your Mother. She's a woman. She knows so much. They don't know anything as to how Kundalini passes through these centres‚ what it does‚ what She is capable of. But the Kundalini itself is the feminine power.

7690,Left-sidedness and Right-sidedness,,Our joy about which we talk‚ within our heart‚ has to manifest outside,"  I have noticed -of course I am also a woman -that women have certain water-powers of crying‚ weeping‚ and thinking they are very miserable and making everybody miserable. This is their power. I've noticed this. I mean‚ this song is the worst song you could sing on any day whatsoever. But it has come into somebody's head‚ is very negative. And not only that‚ but it shows a person who can never be happy‚ and doesn't want anybody to be happy.

So inside every woman there is motherhood‚ there's great capacities‚ sacrifice‚ everything is there. But with that‚ they also should know they are left-sided. And our joy about which we talk‚ within our heart‚ has to manifest outside. People should see that we are joyous‚ that we are happy people‚ that we are not like others who start crying for small things.

Like when My father died‚ I was surprised that suddenly I became thoughtless‚ absolutely thoughtless. For about three days I was thoughtless‚ neither the thought of pain or thought of unhappiness or anything came up; but just thoughtless. And everybody was surprised‚ because I looked after him‚ and I mean he was very attached to Me‚ very fond of Me‚ everything was there. But I was surprised‚ how is it I became suddenly thoughtless?

So if you are a Sahaja Yogini‚ then at the time of crisis you should become thoughtless‚ that's one of the signs. I have seen with Myself‚ if there is any crisis in the family‚ I just become thoughtless. That means what? That God just takes you in‚ your problems‚ He puts His hand‚ He puts His protection and He takes you out of it‚ and makes you absolutely thoughtless      ",https://www.amruta.org/p/54,,,,,,,,,,Mend and women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But there are very sensible women otherwise I've seen‚ in the East and West‚ who have a great sense of bearing‚ a majestic attitude towards life.

I told the girls‚ I said ""Better just wait‚ and what we can do is – all right‚ I am the Mother‚ you can give Me food if you want. I don't mind. Give the boys first‚ and then the girls should eat."" And one of them got very angry with Me. She said‚ ""Mother what is this? They are dominating us."" As if somebody eats before or later‚ what is the domination? I mean‚ in any case you are going to eat before or after. I don't understand the portion of domination.

But see‚ you are privileged that you can look after so many people‚ you see. What is so wrong in it? You see the whole atmosphere is so funny that if the men eat first‚ then women should feel that we are put down. It's absurd‚ because it's a privilege; you are like a Mother‚ you are the person who has to look after them‚ and you have to feed them. It's a privilege that a Gruha Lakshmi should do that‚ look after everybody‚ give them food to eat and treat them just like their protegees; that's it‚ something like that. It's such a privilege‚ it's a sign of complete maturity. Even little‚ little girls‚ you have seen – if they are brought up properly you see‚ otherwise they can be horrifying. But normally little girls are very generous‚ more generous than men are‚ and they are very – you see – always try to make you very happy. They have great sense‚ if somebody is sitting down they'll come and give you food and look after you‚ and – I mean‚ I have seen my all three granddaughters do that. You see‚ even once a washerwoman came in the house‚ they said ""You must sit on the sofa.""

She said ""But no‚ I can't. I can't sit on the sofa.""

""No‚ you must sit on the sofa."" They opened the fan for her and they brought all the things that were in the kitchen for her to eat. And they brought something to eat and this and that.

And the elder one‚ I told her‚ ""What do you want to be?"" She said‚ ""I can only be a nurse or an air hostess."" ""Why? Air hostess and nurse‚ why?""

""These are the only two professions where one can give‚ isn't it‚ food? otherwise there's …. I mean it's a privilege. Other professions you can't do this great job‚ this noble job‚ see‚ of giving food. That's why I want to be either the nurse or the air hostess.""

And they play. I have seen these girls play‚ ""Now I'm the air hostess‚ now you must eat this."" they bring food in small‚ little things‚ you see. They make their own things‚ ""Now I'm air hostess‚"" and they bring it. Now‚ there may not be any food in it‚ there maybe some stones they have put‚ or whatever. ""You must eat‚ you must look after yourself‚ you're thinning down‚ you better       Like that‚ you see‚ so sweet. And then they'll bring some pillows‚ ""Now you must lie down."" Like air hostesses they are working‚ you see.

""Are you feeling cold? Would you like to have a blanket or something?""

I said‚ ""What game is this?"" ""We are air hostesses.""

It's such a privilege‚ an innocent privilege. And that's what – if we develop – this nonsense of a right that ""We are higher‚ they are lower‚"" all this nonsense will go away.

If they start talking like that‚ taking interest in such talks‚ then they come down to the level of others‚ and their motherhood is challenged. Any mother who allows the children to talk like that is really spoiling the entire life of that‚ of children.

Anybody who talks ill of anybody in Sahaja Yoga is really extremely dangerous for both of them‚ but specially for the person who does it. So one should always avoid even thinking ill of others‚ let alone the talking of it. If anybody talks like that‚ you should put your hands to your ears and say‚ ""Don't tell me‚ I don't want to hear anything against anyone."" Because when we start talking against someone‚ we get all the bad things that person has. Apart from that our mind is spoiled‚ is impurity in your mind. Then you talk to others‚ it increases and it becomes worse.

It is the responsibility of the women to be very much careful‚ because this kind ofthing is more with the women because they are a little excluded‚ they have exclusive friends‚ and they have exclusive life. They are different type than men are. Men if they have to get angry with someone or if they want to say something they'll just go and have a fight and finish with it.

We cannot have leaders who have wives who are horrid. We cannot‚ because the wife of a leader is like a mother.

There are five types of mothers described‚ one of them is the one who is the wife of the guru or of the leader. And if the leader has a wife of that kind it's better in all sense he should withdraw.

These stupid women must come round‚ and behave themselves‚ I'm telling you‚ because I've known such women become schizophrenic‚ because they live in imaginary world. Not leaders and they have no business to behave like that.

The wives of the leaders have to look after everyone‚ to be kind to them‚ and they should stand in between the leader and others‚ so that if the leader is‚ supposing angry‚ she should say‚ ""Now it's all right.

This culture relegates women to the level of an inferior human being‚ fit to be dominated by men and children.

In the West also the same thing happens. Children don't respect their mothers‚ neither do they listen to them.

Society itself‚ which is her creation‚ tries to control or put down the womanhood. In the East‚ we can say‚ that due to fundamentalist influence women have been under great pressure and their morality is based on fear rather than freedom. In the West they have fought for their freedom‚ but what they have attained is spurious freedom. The women in the West have freedom to abandon all social and moral values.

Thus in the East‚ we can say‚ that most of the women are timid‚ oppressed and cannot express themselves‚ while in the West we find most of the women are reduced to a sex symbol. They are keen to expose   their bodies. Their anxiety is to appear in fashion advertisements and very cheap popularity.

The women in the West‚ or those who are educated in the West‚ also some others I have seen‚ have gone to the other extreme when they are taking to political‚ economical or administrative roles. To compete with men they have become much too self-willed‚ self-centred and ambitious. They have no more their soothing‚ pleasing qualities which can bring peace and balance. On the contrary‚ they become dominating‚ pleasure-seeking individuals. They are far more worried about their physical attractions than about having a pleasing‚ sweet and dignified personality. They give in to their baser self much faster than men‚ wittingly or unwittingly. All this leads to chaotic societies and children grow up into street urchins‚ preparing for wars.

What we need is a balance between the two extremes. We need women as equal but not similar partners with men‚ but with a subtle understanding of the nature of men and how to bring them into the centre with their inner balance.

If their innocence is not attacked and if they are pure‚ if they see a nude woman they close their eyes‚ they would not like to see a nude woman … or a nude man.

In the periphery of the seven layers‚ we have got ripples of this joy arising; they come to the shores of our brain and create the bubbles of joy. But again if the brain is a very rational rock then these bubbles dissolve‚ giving no effect to the rock. So a loving person is thousand times better than a rational person. But most of the people feel this love only on the periphery of the outermost layer‚ which is the light of the Mooladhara.

As you know that Mooladhara has got excretory effect and how important‚ or relieved we feel when our excretions are all right. It's a basic thing. But that relief gives you a kind of a joy and happiness. Is very gross‚ is very low type as they call it. But very important for us to get that joy. But to make this joy not so dominating over all other joys of deeper sensitivity is to be innocent. I know one cannot be innocent‚ you have to be innocent yourself. But with Sahaja Yoga you can by clearing your Mooladhara. So that is very important that our Mooladharas must be clear‚ our innocence must be established‚ so that these gross joys do not cover the entire spectrum of our life and make us slaves of these gross joy-giving reliefs. But to clean your Mooladhara does not mean by any chance in Sahaja Yoga to get after any kind of obsession and obstruction but to give a natural release like an innocent child to these ripples‚ which need not go back to all the other layers of joy.

You must have seen‚ when the ripples in the ocean touch the shores‚ they turn back. If the shores are made of very hard rocks‚ this turning can be very deep and the waves can go much deeper. If the brain is very ego-oriented – is covered with ego‚ then this joys have a much greater significance in life than normally it is.

The Ganesha at Mooladhara becomes Mahaganesha in the Virata – that is the brain. That means it is the seat of Shri Ganesha. That means Shri Ganesha governs from that seat the principle of innocence. As you know very well it is placed at the back in the region of optic thalamus – optic lobe as they call it and it is the giver of innocence to the eyes.

When He incarnated as Christ – which is in here in the front‚ at Agnya – He said very clearly that ""Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."" It's a very subtle saying‚ which people don't understand what is the meaning of the word adultery. Adultery means impurity in a general word. Any impurity in the eye ""Thou shalt not have"" – it's very difficult. Instead of saying that you get your realization and clear your Back Agnya‚ He has said it in a very short form‚ ""Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."" And people thought‚ it's an impossible situation. Because He was not allowed to live long‚ actually His public life is limited to three-and-a-half years only. So whatever He has said has a very great significance‚ that your eyes should not be adulterous. When there is innocence there is no adultery. It means there's no impurity.

For example‚ with our eyes we see something and we want to possess it. We start thinking. The thought starts like a chain‚ one after another.

Fatherhood‚ any relationship is chastity. Purity is again the fragrance of chastity. Goodness‚ compassion‚ everything comes from chastity‚ a sense of chastity‚ which is not mental. If you are mentally chaste‚ you can be horrid. Like some of the nuns are or some of those people who are austere‚ not that. Chastity is an innate built-in Kundalini within you‚ which acts because it understands Me. She understands Me. She knows Me‚ She's part and parcel of Me‚ it's My reflection.

8330,The power of chastity,,Shri Ganesha shows that we should have sweet temperament," Holiness is not only concerned with your married life‚ also it's concerned with your political life‚ with your economic life‚ with your national life. Chastity is the only keynote for improving all the problematic questions or else solving them completely. There's only one danger among chaste people also‚ that they might become extremely dry or could become very hot-tempered‚ sometimes also ego-oriented. But just the opposite is Shri Ganesha who is on the Left side.

Shri Ganesha's holiness is that of a child‚ eternal childhood. It's so sweet. The whole movement of His body is so delicate and so swift‚ yet… so charming. He eats a modaka‚ which is a sweet which is very simple to make‚ but very tasty – to show that we should have sweet temperament‚ sweet nature. So the idea that people who are very chaste are very rough‚ hot-tempered‚ is absolutely wrong.

Specially for ladies‚ is very important‚ that if they have to understand Sahaja Yoga‚ they must know that Shri Ganesha works on the Left side and not on the Right side. This is a very big mistake when we start using Him on the Right side to express all our wisdom‚ all our love … through holiness.

All right‚ now we have many women so let us have distribution of women according to the men we have. If you have more men then we'll have the other way around.

They said‚ ""How can we marry these young girls?"" you see. So He said‚ ""No‚ all right‚ I'll marry one‚ because where will these young girls go‚ there are no young men left‚ so what to do?"" But these days‚ if you ask an old man of eighty years‚ he would be very willing to marry a girl of eighteen years. Stupid old fool I call him‚ because he doesn't understand.

Attractiveness is all right as long as you are not repulsive‚ as long as you keep the ideal relationship with others. If the relationship becomes nothing but like a dog and bitch's one‚ it's better not to have this kind of an idea. It's absolutely wrong to run after something which is not our way. Human beings have to live with dignity and with complete sense of idealism as far as their relationship with each other is concerned.

In Sahaja Yoga we have to realize‚ man also must know that if their wives are so chaste and so good‚ they must respect them.

They should also realize that they have also rakhi sisters‚ which is that we are very chaste. We respect the chastity of a rakhi sister and we do not want to in any way to comply with anyone who does not respect the chastity. Then the men also become chaste. When the women are chaste men also become chaste. And this chastity is your main power‚ is‚ this chastity is the one‚ is the power of Shri Ganesha.

8380,The power of chastity,,Mental and emotional powers are relative,"  Then what is your power? Is your chastity! But in the West the priorities are absolutely upside down. What is your power? Just think of it. Think within yourself. Is it mental power that's important? I have told you mental power has nothing to do‚ because it is just linear‚ it moves in one direction‚ falls off‚ comes back to you. It has no substance in it. Is just a mind projection‚ plastic. What is your emotional power? Emotions that you have takes you where? See you have emotions for‚ even good emotions you have. Say‚ you love your wife very much. Where does it take you?

There was a poet called Tulsidasa who loved his wife very much and she had gone to her mother's place. So he couldn't bear it and went to see her and he climbed over to her balcony and she got a fright.

She said. ""How did you climb?""

He said. ""You had put a rope there.""

She said. ""No."" And they saw it was a big snake hanging.

So she said. ""The amount of love you have for me. if you have that for God. where will you be?""

So where do these emotions take you? To frustration. to unhappiness. to our destruction. The mental power gives you a horrible thing called ego. which destroys others. And the emotional power gives you nothing but crying. weeping. and always feeling unhappy. ""Oh. I have done so much of emotional investment on such and such person and what did I get?"" So it is not absolute. it's relative. And mentally you are zero if you cannot destroy others. Emotionally you are zero because you cannot overpower people with your emotions.

So what is your power? Where does your power lie? It lies in the Spirit. But even before the Spirit is achieved‚ what is your power? Is Kundalini? She's sleeping. Then what is your power? Is your chastity.

Now for people who are Indian‚ who have respected their Mooladharas‚ there are so many methods and ways given how to raise the power of Mooladhara. But that won't work out with the Western people‚ because it's a damaged one. It's one which is a shattered one‚ and which does not work on the physical side of the Mooladhara‚ but on the emotional side as we call the mana – the Left side.

So‚ even you may not talk in that way‚ but your mind is still in that realm. And you still think on that realm. Even mentally‚ you are in it. Or you are seeing things‚ wanting to see such things‚ wanting to enjoy such things. That lurking attraction is still there. Your Mooladhara cannot strengthen. And we have to realize that I'm talking to Western people. I would not say the same to the people from India. So now we have to work out much harder. To be on the watch-out‚ to deal with yourself.

You have to expose beautiful things‚ like flowers‚ beautiful ornaments. All right? But you're not a thing. It's your private property. You don't put all your gold on the streets‚ do you? Better try that‚ sometimes. You will mind people plundering your gold‚ but you don't mind your chastity being plundered. Everyone looking at you with dirty eyes. You don't feel insulted. Because ego is a dirty stuff. It does not mind. It feels happy that people are watching you. They are plundering you. They are looting your chastity. But Sahaja Yogis are not like that.

They are very confused‚ very confused people. Because there is no wisdom in this kind of life. You become just a sex-oriented personality. It is actually just the other way round. If you are money-oriented‚ you want to preserve money. If you are possession-oriented you want to preserve it. If you get one little antique piece you want to preserve it.

And they're hypocritical sometimes‚ they don't mind being hypocritical about it. They are Sahaja Yogis‚ all right‚ but in this matter they think they can go about the way they like. And sometimes some of them say that ""Mother has said it's all right."" I never said so! There's one point I cannot compromise is this.

You must have a chaste outlook towards yourself‚ towards your life‚ towards your being‚ towards your personality. You are saints. And if a saint doesn't have a good character – I call it the character‚ the essence of character – is not a saint.

So this purity has to be maintained. There cannot be any compromise on that. You cannot hit at the roots of everything. If it works out‚ in a collective way‚ nobody cheats oneself‚ nobody deceives oneself and puts the mind into right track of ascent. Thinking about the ascent‚ how you are going to rise‚ thinking of the moments when you had the joys‚ thinking of the day where you met Me first‚ thinking of all the other beautiful and holy things‚ your mind can be cleansed. And whenever such a thought comes in‚ you have to say‚ ""not this‚ not this‚ not this."" It's more mental than physical‚ I tell you. I know it's difficult‚ but if you can get realization‚ why not this also?

You all have to understand that there is no compromise on this. And a day may come‚ if you continue with it‚ you will be thrown away completely‚ just like any other devil is thrown out. So there is no compromise. Tell yourself‚ don't deceive yourself‚ don't cheat yourself. You cannot ascend if there is any lurking thing within you.

8620,Ideas of western society,,Thirty years back‚ there were no films with evil winning over,"  I remember about‚ say‚ thirty‚ forty years back‚ or even earlier when we saw the films‚ they were not coloured films. American films were beautiful films with substance in it. They wouldn't show one married man running after another married woman. None of these stories. Very pure form of beautiful family life. Everything nourishing was shown.

We don't hear of any such thing where they showed evil winning over. Now you find they show a thief‚ and the thief becomes the hero. Then the people see those films‚ and the children especially I've seen have that thief as the symbol of something great. So they are going against the Void completely‚ against the religion that is within us‚ absolutely.

The thing that was to nourish the Void‚ the one that was to sustain you in your valency (dharma)‚ is now disturbing the Void completely. That's the maya part of it – the same electricity which was to give you the right path‚ the light in the darkness‚ is now sucking you in like a magnet towards your destruction      ",https://www.amruta.org/p/3884,,,,,,,,,,Mend and women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8630,Ideas of western society,,You have to prove that innocence is to be respected,"  First of all‚ we have to understand we are born in very precarious‚ dangerous times. At the time of Christ there were very few people who followed him and they didn't understand much about Kundalini either. They had no knowledge. They had no knowledge that Christ was the incarnation of Shri Ganesh. But in the Christian countries only you'll find the insult of Christ‚ the insult of innocence openly done‚ sometimes legally accepted.

So when we are born under such horrible circumstances‚ we have to build up a great force‚ ourselves‚ of spirituality. When I came today‚ there was no breeze‚ no leaf was moving‚ but you were singing songs and tremendous breeze was coming from you all‚ and that made Me understand that this Divine force has come into being. It is there‚ it's working. Not only that‚ but it's very powerful. Normally‚ the breeze doesn't come to Me‚ it goes the other way around. But it was such a tremendous breeze that I had to hold somebody's hand‚ and not a leaf was moving. So with this collective force that you have‚ you must remember you have to fight it‚ not to run away‚ don't escape it. You have to fight it and you have to prove that innocence is to be respected.

Adi Shakti first made Shri Ganesh. It was the first deity was created. Why? Because She wanted to fill the whole atmosphere with chaitanya‚ with holiness‚ with auspiciousness. It is still there. It's still everywhere you can feel chaitanya is working‚ but it does not penetrate into the modern minds because modern mind doesn't know what this innocence is. They have no idea at all about innocence. The way they are going on everywhere is really something never happened on this earth.

They don't understand how important it is for human life to have innocence being respected within themselves and also without.

The human life is different from that of animal life. Animals are controlled all the time‚ or we can say they are under a complete imprisonment‚ you can say‚ under the will of Lord Sadashiva.

This Freudian knowledge was accepted without even thinking why Freud did that. Freud was a jew‚ and he found that many Christians tortured the jews in America. This is another anti-Christ activity.

Escalator they were kissing‚ in the thing they were kissing‚ I mean‚ torturing all the Indians who were there or maybe the other people‚ Chinese‚ for example‚ Egyptians. Such an exhibition going on.

I said‚ ""Why were you kissing that day so much?""

So they said‚ ""Because we were going to be divorced‚ so wanted to have the last bit of it"".

8900,The brother and sister relationship,,We have to settle ourselves on very holy relationships with each other,"  But now with Rakhi sister is even better. Now with Rakhi sister we have established a beautiful atmosphere that somebody who is a brother‚ you cannot have any funny relationships with that person. It kills all your flirtations‚ all your funny‚ funny relationships that one develops‚ all kinds of marriage breaking problems‚ and people going astray‚ once you have understood the principle that we have to first settle ourselves on very holy relationship with each other.

This is the way‚ in Sahaja Yoga‚ we establish that holy relationship. And moreover‚ one has to see that this holy relationship gives you joy‚ happiness‚ and pleasure. It is not just a holy relationship of some force or some sort of a thing. Even if you cannot give anything to your sister‚ or the brother cannot do anything for the sister‚ doesn't matter. The relationship is in the heart‚ and is felt very much and when you feel it‚ that relationship‚ that sweetness of purity‚ of holiness‚ flows.

8910,The brother and sister relationship,,Except for my wife the rest of them are my sisters,"  This relationship is so pure which doesn't want anything. A wife may say that‚ ""If you don't give me a coat‚ I'll divorce you."" In England and possibly in America they may say so. But a sister cannot divorce. She cannot divorce it. This time in the newspaper‚ they published the name of My brother. So I said‚ ""What can I do? He's My brother‚ so he's My brother."" Good‚ bad‚ anything‚ he's My brother‚ I cannot divorce him. It's something‚ a relationship which you cannot break. Nature has given you this relationship.

But when you come to the collective‚ is very important that we must respect this relationship. If you do not respect this relationship‚ you cannot work out collectively. Like in a party I go and I feel something very funny happening. Somebody's wife is entangled with somebody's husband. All sorts of funny things happen. But in collective if you know‚ except for my wife the rest of them are my sisters. The purity settles in like that‚ you don't have to worry. They're my sisters. And your eyes steady out.

In the beginning of Sahaja Yoga‚ I found it impossible to establish this. So I said‚ ""Let's try the Vishnumaya."" And it worked. Actually‚ naturally we know this is wrong.

But it can be the other way around. I have seen people‚ like there was a bhootish woman‚ who turned out to be very bhootish‚ and then somebody said‚ ""But she's my rakhi sister."" So what?

There are many incidents in our history‚ I don't know if I can cite anything in your history. But I would say when I see Abraham Lincoln‚ I think he was a great brother to the Statue of Liberty. The way he fought for women in such pure love and without taking any money‚ without charging them anything‚ to punish the husbands who were drunkards.

9000,The role of a brother,,A sister is to be protected," The brothers who do not bother about the chastity of the husband of their sister‚ and also support him and ask him to do wrong things‚ hide his things‚ are also equally responsible. Like in Sahaja Yoga‚ you know that a sister is to be protected; and the sister's husband‚ if he's doing anything wrong‚ he's to be told off by the brother.

Like once in India‚ one newspaper passed some remarks about Me. My brothers were up in arms. I thought‚ ""Now‚ it's going to be terrible. How am I to manage it?"" It was a big problem.

They were going to go to the courts. When I told them‚ ""I'll not go to the courts.""

""All right‚ don't go. But we'll go."" They told My husband also.

My husband and My brothers put together was formidable! I didn't know what to do. I wrote to one Sahaja Yogi that‚ ""Go and see the editor of the newspaper. Tell him that these are My brothers‚ be careful. They are very powerful people in India and from here My husband."" It's terrible.

But they would not apologize. So I thought of another Vishnumaya‚ that there was a big strike and the paper was closed for exactly six months. And they had to go in for big‚ very big losses. And when they started‚ the people who were working there came back and said that‚ ""Why did you write against Shri Mataji? We're not going to come back.""

9010,The role of a brother,,What a poetic thing to say,"  In the history that I know of two very beautiful incidents I'll tell you which come to My mind‚ today is one of Shivaji. When Shivaji

– twice it happened in his lifetime which is very remarkable – was once presented with a lady who was very beautiful. And people had plundered her things and all her ornaments‚ because she was a daughter of a Muslim courtesan‚ as you call the courtier. And they tried to plunder‚ and they brought this beautiful woman before Shivaji.

So Shivaji looked at her and said‚ ""Please remove your veil‚"" because Muslims have a veil. And when she removed her veil‚ he said that‚ ""If my mother was as beautiful as you are‚ I would have been equally beautiful.""

What a thing to say – what a poetic thing to say! That is that‚ ""If you were my mother‚ I would have been as beautiful as you are‚"" means you are my sister. And then he got very angry with all these people and he asked them that‚ ""You'd better take her away and never do such a thing to any woman."" And not only‚ but he gave lots of ornaments and lots of things to her to say that she's a sister going to the husband with all respect and regard. And this gentleman‚ her husband‚ was a very deadly enemy of Shivaji. How he solved the problem with such purity and then this gentleman became sort of a milder person with this gesture of his      ",https://www.amruta.org/p/3884,,,,,,,,,,Mend and women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9020,The role of a brother,,Only on that rakhi. Think of that‚ only one rakhi!,"  Second in his lifetime we hear about a fort which is now very close to My house in Pune. There was a Rajput lady called Kamal Kumari‚ who was entrapped by the man who was the officer of that fort‚ who was a Muslim. And he was telling this Kamal Kumari that ""You must marry me."" And she would not accept. They had brought her from somewhere sort of by force. And she would not accept; she was a Rajput. And he said‚ ""By tomorrow‚ you'll have to marry me."" This lady didn't know what to do‚ so with someone very secretly she sent a letter to Shivaji with a rakhi. But it reached the mother of Shivaji.

Mother sent a letter‚ sent a message‚ to Shivaji on a horse that‚ ""Come here as fast as possible – if you're eating your food‚ then come here to wash your hands"" – to that extent. And Shivaji was so obedient to his mother‚ very obedient. One has to learn from his character. He rushed there‚ because obedience was his power.

He rushed there and asked‚ ""Mother‚ what is it?"" So she said‚ ""No‚ I want to play chess with you.""

He said‚ ""Why now?"" ""I must play chess."" He couldn't understand. And she played chess and she won something. She could have told him‚ but she just wanted to sort of put a Vishnumaya on him.

He lost. ""Mother‚ what do you want?""

She said‚ ""Today I want you by night to capture this fort."" ""Today?""

""Yes.""

Then she showed him the letter and the rakhi. Rakhi was so powerful that a mother had to ask her son‚ who was responsible for the deliverance of Maharashtra from the clutches of the Muslims‚ that he should go to this fort and capture it. Such a powerful message out of that string. So. All right. Came out. He was quite upset; how to do it? Suddenly there was one gentleman called Tanaji‚ had come to invite him for his son's wedding with his uncle. And he saw him so upset he said‚ ""Why are you so upset‚ sir?"" He said‚ ""My mother has asked me such and such thing.""

He said‚ ""All right‚ I'm going. You don't have to go‚ because we'll have many Tanaji's like me but we have only one Shivaji. I'm going to do it.""

He said‚ ""But your son is going to marry.""

He said‚ ""First let my sword marry this fort‚ then I will marry my son.""

Such people we had also. Such sacrifice. Only on that rakhi. Think of that‚ only one rakhi! All right. They didn't know this girl‚ they didn't know her father‚ they didn't know anything about her‚ they had never seen her. Can you think of somebody who will do like this in modern times? We are supposed to be very evolved‚ powerful‚ great people. Even in the pictures we need not show it. Nobody will come to see such a film because they'll feel so low.

And he went there and he used a kind of a big lizard which went and fixed the nails. With a rope he climbed up and they conquered and won that fort.

It was decided that if they are successful they should light a fire which Shivaji can see and come down. He saw the fire early in the morning so went there. And under a tree the dead body of this Tanaji was lying. He looked at it and he said‚ ""We have got the fort but we have lost a lion."" That's why it's called as the Fort of the Lion – Sinhagad‚ which you can see from My house very clearly. But these are the monuments of a small thing called a rakhi.

Alexander had married an Indian lady and the great Alexander was in jail. That was the day of Vishnumaya. So she sent – this lady was very clever‚ his wife – she sent a rakhi in a small‚ little thali covered nicely to the King Puru. And‚ as the rituals are‚ that day this was presented to him. So he had to accept. If it is sent‚ you have to accept. A sister sends it with deliberations but you have to accept. And he accepted it‚ and it was tied.

Then he said‚ ""Who is my sister?""

They said‚ ""Your sister is the wife of Alexander.""

He said‚ ""Oh God‚ that means I have arrested my own brother-in- law!"" Immediately becomes a brother-in-law‚ immediately. No marriage took place‚ nothing. He's a brother-in-law.

He rushed to the jail‚ fell flat before the great emperor. He couldn't understand what's happening to Puru? Why did he do all this?

He said‚ ""Sir‚ I am sorry‚"" in his own language‚ ""I'm sorry I didn't know you were my brother-in-law. I'm sorry whatever I've done. Will you forgive me?"" and all that. And he brought him‚ asked him to sit on his throne. He couldn't understand‚ ""What's this going on?""

""Please."" Made him sit there‚ garlanded him‚ did his aarti‚ gave him ornaments‚ gave him big garlands of diamonds and rubies and things‚ and touched his feet‚ washed his feet and then‚ with great honour‚ sent him home.

He couldn't understand. ""Has he gone mad or he's possessed by someone?"" He must have thought some Greek has possessed this fellow‚ the way he was surrendering.

When he went home his wife was smiling. He said‚ ""Why are you smiling?""

She said‚ ""I knew the trick will work with Indian mind."" ""What was the trick?""

She showed him one string. ""This was the trick.""

He couldn't understand‚ started looking at it. ""What is this?""

She said‚ ""This is the rakhi. This is the thing I sent him. This has the symbol of a sister‚ that's how you're released.""

Alexander sat back. He said‚ ""Oh God‚ these people can release their enemies on a string? I can't capture these people. They are too good. They are too subtle. These subtleties we cannot understand."" And he turned back.

9050,The tradition of Raksha bandhan,https://youtu.be/NODEcG_O7a0,Raksha Bandhan is the bondage of protection," Today in India‚ we celebrate a special festival. It is called as Raksha Bandhan. Rakshan means protection and Bandhan means the bondage‚ the bondage of protection. It's a very nice‚ good‚ social custom to have this beautiful festival today. Today is the full moon day‚ and this day what we do is to tie a band of threads around the person whom you want to protect. It is done between brothers and sisters. The sisters tie this bondage to the wrist of the brothers‚ and when we do that‚ they're putting all their love around the wrist‚ that it is the day for giving all their love‚ everything to their brother‚ as a protection‚ as a symbol of their protection th rough that thread. It's a very‚ very simple thread they use. And this is has to be tied on the left- hand side. But people tie it on the right-hand side‚ which is a mistake‚ but it has to be tied on the left-hand side.

In our Sahaja Yoga the significance of left wrist is that it is the left Vishuddhi. Left Vishuddhi‚ which is here. And this is the left Vishuddhi expressed here‚ you know that very well. Now‚ left Vishuddhi is the place where our relationship of brothers and sisters exist. When they are disturbed within us‚ we start getting the problem of the left Vishuddhi. In these modern times‚ the talk of pure relationship seems to be quite boring for many people‚ but it's very practical and logical. I would say it is the most scientific thing to do. For example‚ every brother has a special feeling for a sister‚ and her chastity is very dear to every brother‚ if he is a normal person. If he is abnormal‚ then forget it. But normally a brother is very particular about the chastity of the sister‚ and he doesn't like anybody to – in any way – even pass a remark against the chastity of his sister. I mean these natural things we might have lost because of‚ whatever you may call it‚ the modern style of thinking or the machinery that is sitting on our heads‚ but the normal thing is to feel that way‚ purely‚ about the sister. And the sister about the brother.

9070,The tradition of Raksha bandhan,,All your life you carry on that relationship with that nobility,"  So after that is the second day‚ is very important‚ which is here‚ is the brother and sister special day‚ where the sister invites the brother to her house for food. And if he is a small boy she will give him a bath; even if he is a big boy he sits with all his clothes on and she will throw water on him and puts something very fragrant things on his body and gives him a bath nicely and gives him a protection. It's a purity of relationship between a sister and a brother. And then the brother gives her something as a present at that time. He may give anything‚ it's just symbolic. It's the love and affection of a brother and sister is expressed at that time‚ is very important. And then the sister‚ you see‚ actually gives him a bandhan‚ with actual light‚ which we call as the aarti they do for the brother. And that's how they try to give a big protection to them.

So this is the day of the – they call it in Marathi Bhayadwij – that is the second day of the moon‚ that dark moon. That has significance because it is very important that our relationship as a brother and a sister‚ must be strengthened‚ must be purified‚ must be looked after.

In India‚ even if somebody calls you a sister or a brother‚ then he is a sister or a brother; it is a very difficult situation. If somebody calls you a sister‚ then you have to accept that situation. And if you accept that situation‚ all your life you have to carryon that relationship of that nobility‚ whether he may be your brother or not‚ doesn't matter; she may your sister or not‚ does not matter.

9080,The principle of maryadas,,We have to understand that how to keep our relationships in proper respect to each other's modesty and chastity,"  Now we have to understand the maryadas‚ about which I have told you before also. The relationships between men and women are only pure if a certain amount of boundaries are kept. Like‚ supposing you have milk in one container and you have got something else in another container. To keep the purity of one container‚ you have to keep it in its bounds‚ in the cup. If you allow them to mix up‚ if they fall together and they mix up‚ then there is no purity. It's a simple thing like that. One should understand that we have to understand that how to keep our relationships in proper respect to each other's modesty and chastity.

Now for example‚ there is a girl who is younger to you. You must keep all the distance from such a person. If she is much older than you‚ then it is all right. You can talk‚ laugh‚ joke – she's much older than you. But normally with a girl who is younger to you‚ even much younger‚ you should try to keep away‚ after all if she is a young girl; not with the children‚ but still. You must learn these things‚ how to maintain a distance. Now‚ there is a man who is younger to you‚ then you must not have any funny ideas about such a person – is absolutely absurd      ",https://www.amruta.org/p/1453,,,,,,,,,,Mend and women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Chastity,,

And such a relationship one should develop with a lady‚ any woman or any friend you want to have. One should remember that it cannot cross a certain limit‚ there has to have a maryada. Otherwise they will become brothers and sisters and then they marry‚ it's not possible. So we have to have the boundaries; that is very important. In Sahaja Yoga we have to have maryadas and boundaries. And one of them is this: that once you call somebody a brother or a sister‚ is absolutely pure relationship. Little further we'll go with that and that the relationship with a – as I have told you before‚ that with your‚ say – husband's younger brothers is just like that they are like your younger brothers‚ all of them‚ husband's younger brothers or younger Sahaja Yogis than your husbands‚ are. The other way round is for all the ladies‚ we can say‚ all the men‚ their wives‚ elder ladies‚ elder to your wives‚ are like sisters‚ elder sisters.

I mean this relationship is so sweet and gives you a certain amount of understanding: how much distance is kept with whom‚ with whom to be free and with whom to have the distance    ",https://www.amruta.org/p/76,,,,,,,,,,Mend and women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

9110,The principle of maryadas,,The enjoyment is higher than any romance‚ marriage or worldly thing," The maryadas of relationships between you is relationship of pure love‚ of purity. Unless and until you develop pure relationships‚ you are going to be ruined. See‚ this finger has to have pure relationship with this hand. Supposing if this finger has some dirty feelings about this hand‚ it may dirty it‚ it may spoil it. In the same way‚ we should have extremely pure relationships with each other. Means‚ we should try to give our heart to another person without any lust or greed in it‚ that we should try to do. Try to help each other. I find when they feel in a lusty way‚ or a greedy way attached to others – this is not for the Sahaja Yogis‚ but non Sahaja Yogis – they get so much interested in that person. It's a very baser way of attachment.

But in Sahaja Yoga‚ your attachment is with your Spirit‚ with your Atma. And Atma is the purest form of our being. We have to keep it absolutely pure. And then the enjoyment is higher than any romance‚ any marriage‚ any worldly thing. It's the highest and the top-most. First achieve that. First of all you should arise and achieve that. Achieve that purity. That is very important.

Now the relationship between the men and women‚ I have told you that you should not try to enter into any bedrooms where the ladies are. It's not proper. Nor the women should enter into men's thing      ",https://www.amruta.org/p/1453,,,,,,,,,,Mend and women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9120,The principle of maryadas,,It's not imposed on us‚ it is innate," So the first thing is that we should understand that Ganesha gives us maryadas‚ limits‚ it is innate within us. It's not imposed on us‚ it is innate. A little girl if you see‚ she's shy‚ she knows how to protect herself. Even the boys‚ they are shy and they try to protect themselves‚ but that innate innocence we try to flout‚ because ego is there. ""What's wrong?"" You tell them anything: ""What's wrong?"" And you do not know how devastating it is   ...""",https://www.amruta.org/p/6597,,,,,,,,,,Mend and women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9130,The principle of maryadas,,If you really work out your Shri Ganesha – the best is to meditate,"  I mean‚ there are no maryadas. And that means you are denying Ganesha completely. Ganesha has created those maryadas innately within us. Even a prostitute in India‚ if she has to take to that profession because she's forced into it‚ maybe she's been brought from somewhere or maybe that out of her big problems she might have been a prostitute; she will see that her child is saved. She knows that it's wrong. But here it is so bad that we do not know also that it is wrong. Can you imagine‚ this is the limit of things‚ that you see yourself getting drowned in the water and you know that you are going to be killed. Still you are enjoying‚ ""Very nice‚ I am going to be killed."" This is the situation of the wisdom. This is really shocking.

So we have to now understand what are our maryadas are‚ how we have to live within our maryadas‚ and I'm sure if you really work out your Shri Ganesha – for that the best is to meditate. Put yourself on some nice turf‚ grass. Sit on that. Put your left hand with the light‚ and right hand on the Mother Earth‚ and say Atharva Sheersha. If you can remember it by heart‚ it's a very good thing. Otherwise‚ you can keep the book and read it‚ or say Ganesha's mantra to begin with. It's going to help you very much. It's going to help you‚ your eyes‚ it's going to your whole thing‚ it's going to be very nice      ",https://www.amruta.org/p/6597,,,,,,,,,,Mend and women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9140,The principle of maryadas,,We should also try to watch ourselves,"  It's very serious for Sahaja Yogis. Very‚ very serious. They have to revive their innocence. They have to revive their maryadas. They have to delimit themselves. It's very important. Otherwise‚ as I would say‚ that if you have some wheat spread out everywhere‚ how can you reach the heights? You have to put them into some bags‚ some maryadas. Only by maryadas you can rise. Of course the Kundalini will help. Of course Ganesha will help also. But we should also try to watch ourselves. There should be introspection: ""Are we still in the same category?""

9190,About flirting and falling in love,,So your attention has to shine through the window of Divine," There are many people have asked Me one question. How to steady the Agnya? Agnya is placed at the crossing point of our nerves and also optic thalamus. Now‚ so it is said that if you have wobbling eyes you'll have a wobbling Agnya. You have to steady your eyes. You have to soothe them.

Now it is very‚ very out of date‚ ancient‚ old and all sorts of names that you call it to a thing like that. But you must steady your eyes and steady them in such a way that it is very soothing for the eyes. Which is the most soothing thing for the eyes is the green grass. If you could see the green grass with your eyes means you walk with your eyes on the ground. Your eyes will be soothed‚ your Agnya will be all right. That's why Christ said that‚ ""I tell you about the adulterous eyes."" He talked about adulterous eyes. The eyes with which you do adultery.

It is a very common thing these days. Every woman a man must see. Every man a woman must see. As if it is the most important job. If you have not seen one woman you're finished. I mean this is being modern. But I am an old fashioned lady. And at the time of Christ he said‚ ""You should not have adulterous eyes."" And the ones who have adulterous eyes are‚ no more than any other‚ but our Western Christians. Who all the time even in the church‚ even when they're giving sermons‚ their eyes are moving with adultery.

These eyes have to be very‚ very pure‚ very‚ very deep and very loving when you want to have your Agnya all right. Because you receive through your eyes. Say if you have closed your eyes‚ you do not put your attention to anything because your eyes are closed. You are not adding more thoughts to yourself. But if your eyes are open you are adding much more thoughts‚ because everywhere the eyes go the attention goes and you see things and create thoughts and put in them.

So your attention which has to go to the Spirit‚ which has to go to God‚ which has to shine through the window of Divine. This beautiful thing is ruined by the way we use our eyes and we do not respect it. There's nothing so pure and beautiful as the grass on the ground or the ground itself‚ which takes our feet‚ which supports us‚ which looks after us‚ enriches us. We should put our eyes on the Mother Earth instead of looking at every person      ",https://www.amruta.org/p/2036,,,,Treatments,,,Agnya,,,Mend and women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9200,About flirting and falling in love,,We are wasting such a lot of energy for what?," But from Sahaja Yoga point of view now many of you know what happens to your eyes when you look at somebody. Maybe a entity might enter your eyes. And it is‚ you'll be amazed that it is the play of the entity what we call this so-called flirting is. I've talked about it before also and people didn't like it when I told them about it. But I have seen actual entities entering from eyes to eyes. I have seen very simple people who come down to such places‚ say in a party. In a party people are just exchanging entities from one eye to another. Once it goes to another person he puts his entity into another person. And that third goes into another person. All the time your attention is diverted. And you feel it is attracted towards something‚ you do not know why it is attracted.

Now the certain symbols are also made like that. To add up to the problems‚ you see all the society is working at it. That you should appear in such a way that every man should look at you.

10180,,,First day – Dhanatrayodashi (13th day of the moon),Now‚ the principle of Gruha Lakshmi has been evolved and developed by the Divine: it is not a human beings' creation‚ and as you know‚ it resides in the left nabhi.

10190,,,First day – Dhanatrayodashi (13th day of the moon),"Then you have your wife as Gruha Lakshmi. So we have to have a wife as Gruha Lakshmi. These two things one should understand very‚ very clearly because we confuse them. Wife is the Gruha Lakshmi‚ is the one‚ she is the goddess of the household. Now she has to be the goddess also‚ I mean she just doesn't become goddess just by becoming. You have to become again. You have to become the Goddess. And‚ the Goddess of the Gruha Lakshmi is‚ you can say‚ that the deity of the Gruha – of the house – is a Gruha Lakshmi. Now‚ this deity must become one with the housewife. Then the blessings of the Lakshmi essence is that well-being comes to you. If she is not the Goddess‚ you will always suffer. You will always have problems; you will always have all kinds of untold miseries. It is her blessings which brings you solace‚ peace and redemption‚ redemption of everything. So‚ that's why the left Nabhi is very important as we know and that is always bad in the West. So‚ I would say that the whole society is responsible for spoiling that because housewife is not respected. First of all‚ we should blame our society. Our housewives are not respected. Housewife is the one who is a dedicated wife placed even higher than Yatiis. Yatiis are the highest evolved you can say‚ Avadhutas are the highest evolved seers. And‚ a dedicated wife has got more powers than even in Yatii‚ it is said so. And‚ even Krishna was little worried about that. Everybody had to worry! So‚ the dedicated wife‚ you see‚ the Gruha Lakshmi‚ is such an important thing because she is the essence of this well-being which is peace. I think I have so far never talked to you about peace. And‚ peace is only achieved though the Gruha Lakshmi‚ through your proper adjustment of your spleen I should say. Because spleen is the giver of the blood cells‚ all right? It creates the nutrition for the whole body. If there is no peace in that area within us the whole system can go out‚ because that's the nourishing center within us‚ that's the nourishing center. And that center which nourishes also peace‚ you see the peace. You must have heard this ""Ya Devi‚ sarva bhuteshu shanti rupena samstitha""‚ the Goddess that is the Shanti which is present in every human being as peace.

Now Narakasura was the one who was the devil from the hell‚ let's say – very cunning‚ very clever – and he was killed by the Goddess. Actually he was killed by another incarnation‚ Kartikeya‚ but Goddess gave Him the power to kill. So when he was killed it was celebrated because the evil was killed – the one which teaches us evil‚ to do evil to others. If you are busy doing evil to others you can never enjoy‚ because you enjoy doing evil to others.

It's very easy to say that this Sahaja yogi is caught-up‚ that Sahaja yogi is like that‚ but very difficult to say‚ ""Mother‚ I am caught up. I have got this problem within myself."" So when you start seeing yourself your heart opens out. Unless and until you learn how to open out your heart how can you enjoy? Open your heart. Many people live on very superficial level. All right‚ some of them might say that‚ ""I am possessed‚ Mother. I've got this possession."" Why? ""I've got this conditioning‚ that conditioning."" But why? You don't want to enjoy. So watch yourself‚ see for yourself. This is my conditioning‚ ""All right‚ I'll put you right."" See in the mirror. Tell yourself ""This kind of a useless conditioning I've got it from where? Because I'm Indian‚ because I'm French‚ because of English."" Open the heart. And opening the heart is only possible if Narakasura sitting on your heart is killed‚ finished‚ once for all. In small‚ small things there is joy. In very little things also there's a ripple of joy. If you are sensitive you can catch it. And why not enjoy? Why have these stupid conditionings on our heads for nothing at all‚ that we can't enjoy? Enjoyment is only possible if you take out this one‚ sitting on your heart. So that is the second part of the Diwali that you have to open your heart. ",https://www.amruta.org/p/4389,Diwali,,,,,,,,,,,Karttikeya,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10320,,,Second day – Naraka Chaturdashi (14th day of the Moon),And the second day is even more important‚ because Narakasura was killed. Horrible Narakasura as you know him. But actually that day many rakshasas are killed  ... That's the day fixed for killing rakshasas. And then they are put in the hell; on the fourteenth day they are put in the hell. So that's called as Naraka Chaturdashi‚ that is the day when the hell is opened out. That day Sahaja Yogis are supposed to sleep in the night while everybody does all kinds of tantrikavidya and all that on the fourteenth. ,https://www.amruta.org/p/100,Diwali,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10330,,,Second day – Naraka Chaturdashi (14th day of the Moon),You should fast on only one day‚ definitely you must. That is Naraka Chaturdeshi.

10340,,,Second day – Naraka Chaturdashi (14th day of the Moon),The Sahaja Yogis are going to kill him [Narakasura]. You have to come up to a point and definitely he can be killed. When Kartikeya is awakened within you he can be killed. But for that you have to be just like gold‚ untarnishable. You need strong people to do that. A sword that can kill him has to come out of your metals‚ then Narakasura can be killed. ,https://www.amruta.org/p/484,Diwali,,,,,,,,,,,Karttikeya,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10350,,,Third day – Shri Lakshmi puja (no moon day),Then the fifteenth day is the darkest night which we had‚ darkest night‚ that is the night when you put the lights on because it is the darkest night when the negative forces can walk in. So the lights are put because Lakshmi can come in. ,https://www.amruta.org/p/484,Diwali,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10360,,,Third day – Shri Lakshmi puja (no moon day),Today I want to tell you about the celebration of this night called as Lakshmi Puja‚ it's the day when they worship Lakshmi. So one has to understand that Lakshmi represents the power by which we evolve. It's the power by which we are redeemed‚ the redeeming power; by which we improve from baser self to higher self. To begin with‚ you see‚ is the Lakshmi form. First is the Lakshmi. ,https://www.amruta.org/p/6739,Diwali,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10370,,,Third day – Shri Lakshmi puja (no moon day),She is standing on the lotus and wearing also a pink sari‚ that is you have to have balance to stand on a thing like a lotus because She is surrounded by water‚ and there are many animals around it‚ beast-like people who try to entice her. So she has to have a complete balance. Also she has two hands with a lotus and with two other hands she is giving and with another hand she is blessing. This one means that she should be generous‚ she should be giving always to others not for herself. She should not spend all the money on herself and nothing for the children or for the guests or for others. So it is the Lakshmi who has to give‚ who has to be generous. ,https://www.amruta.org/p/41,Diwali,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10380,,,Third day – Shri Lakshmi puja (no moon day),"This Lakshmi was born or came out of the sea‚ the great sea‚ which was churned thousands and thousands of years back. And She came out of the sea because She is the daughter of the sea. That's why She's called as Neeraja. ""Neera"" means ""water"" and ""ja"" means ""born out of."" This has happened thousands and thousand years back that She was born. So what is that? What is this Lakshmi  ... see symbolically‚ what is it expressing? It is expressing the awareness. Lakshmi expresses awareness‚ and She came out of the sea‚ you know that; the awareness first started growing in the sea. ",https://www.amruta.org/p/100,Diwali,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10390,,,Third day - Shri Lakshmi puja (no moon day),It had to be in the sea because first the animals were born in the sea only – becomes‚ when She comes out of the sea‚ becomes a Raja Lakshmi and a Gruha Lakshmi. Raja Lakshmi is the one where collectively‚ collectively you enjoy your wellbeing‚ collectively‚ on the right hand side‚ you can say. Like‚ we have some places which are for public usage here‚ public wellbeing. And‚ Gruha Lakshmi is the one which is for the individual‚ individual wellbeing. ,https://www.amruta.org/p/6739,Diwali,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10400,,,Third day - Shri Raja Lakshmi,"Raja Lakshmi‚ means the Goddess who rules the kings. It's a very important thing today to understand that something has basically gone wrong in the working of our political systems and why the people have lost their sense of justice‚ fair play and the benevolence of the people. Then Raja Lakshmi is the one who stands on dharma. She stands on dharma. If there is some adharmi then She'll not bless that person. Adharmi is to be taken out. But if he's not‚ then She will go all out to save that person. But if She finds he's adharmi She will not. It's a kind of a divine discretion you should have as to whom to be kind with and whom to be punishing with. [  ...]
So the person who is innately a King has the blessings of Raja Lakshmi. Then what does She do? What does She do to such a man? What She does first: his name is written on the hearts of the people whom he rules. She writes it with her own hands. They adore‚ they admire him and they try to imbibe his qualities within themselves. You are special people so try to make yourself such beautiful instruments of Raja Lakshmi that when people see you they'll vote for you and tomorrow you'll rule the world. ",https://www.amruta.org/p/1950,Diwali,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10410,,,Third day – Shri Lakshmi puja (no moon day),"[  ...] that Raja Lakshmi comes through the activity of the people. And‚ if you are inactive‚ Raja Lakshmi will go down. So‚ we come to the point where we have to be active. We have to be active producing more wealth. You see‚ not like taking out the wealth from here‚ putting to something else but we should produce more wealth.
Now‚ how do you produce more wealth‚ we should see that. By changing forms‚ by anything we should get to it that we should produce more wealth. For example‚ if Sahaja Yogis think that‚ ""All right‚ I'm not going to work and I'm going to sit at home and I'm just going to be‚ say‚ sort of a dish washer."" That's not the way. Sahaja Yogis have not only to work‚ but to work according to their deserving. Apart from that‚ they should improve. All the Sahaja Yogis must have a profession which is perfected. It's not like this that ""I'm‚ I'm just a waster."" All right‚ accepting the situation‚ ""I'm a waster‚ sitting like a waster and doing no activity.""
Only then‚ the problems like the ones we had come up that you start earning money out of women‚ or do sort of useless things like swindling and telling stories‚ taking out money. So wasters are not allowed in Sahaja Yoga. Anybody who tries to be a waster will be thrown out. Never justify your inefficiency‚ inadequacy or incompetence. You have to be first class‚ competent people in every respect.
There should be no diffidence in you. If there is diffidence you are no good for Sahaja Yoga. So‚ not that you should get after the money but after Raja Lakshmi. Means‚ there should be complete activity of your complete manifestation of all your qualities.
Try to improve‚ try to improve. That doesn't mean you run a rat race‚ like a mad cap‚ nothing of Sahaja Yoga. Not that. It doesn't mean that. I have to warn you there. But you should not be just a waster‚ you see‚ that you don't have to pounce here and like a beggar you are moving about. This is not proper. Try to improve your conditions‚ try to improve your techniques‚ try to improve your competence and understanding of the whole subject.
So‚ today on a Diwali day we have to say that we will become more competent – experts in whatever we are doing. We have to be ! We have to be people with impressions.",https://www.amruta.org/p/6739,Diwali,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10420,,,Third day - The nine aspects of Shri Lakshmi ,"Now first is the Adya Lakshmi. Adya is the one who is The Primordial‚ Primordial Lakshmi. As I told you about‚ She came out of the Sea. So that's what we call Christ's Mother – She was called as Mary‚ Maria‚ because She came from Marine. People don't know why she was called as Mary. My name also‚ as you know‚ is Nira‚ meaning ""coming from water"".
Then the second one is Vidya Lakshmi. She's the one who teaches you the technique of handling the Divine Power. Now this [is] to be understood very well. What is a Lakshmi? Lakshmi is graciousness. So She teaches you how to use this power with graciousness. Now‚ this is what the blessing is going to do to you‚ so that you get the power of Adya Lakshmi by which you become like water. And what is the water? It has a cleansing power and it shines. Without water we cannot exist. It's life. So the first blessing for you is that the face shines‚ with Adya Lakshmi‚ that you become cleansing and that you can sink all that is material‚ all that is light can float on you. Now‚ the Vidya Lakshmi is the one‚ as I told you‚ who gives you knowledge‚ knowledge of how to handle the Divine Power graciously. I'll give you an example: I've seen many people when they give bandhan‚ it's such a crude way‚ that  ... No! It is not to be done! It's a Lakshmi's blessing. So how you do it‚ very carefully. You see me‚ how I give always. I never do that way! I cannot! With respect‚ with grace. She represents the respect part of it. And that you get that knowledge – how to do it gracefully. Everything is to be done gracefully‚ in a manner that looks gracious. See‚ some people who talk have no grace‚ some people who give knowledge of Sahaja Yoga also have no grace and they talk in a disgraceful manner. So all the grace‚ how to use the knowledge of the Divine‚ is given by Vidya Lakshmi. Now Saubhagya Lakshmi. She's the one who gives you good fortune. Good fortune doesn't mean money‚ but it means the grace of money. Many people have money but it's like money on a donkey. You do not find any grace in that person. [  ...] Saubhagya doesn't mean only money‚ it means all the good luck. All the good luck in everything in a very gracious manner‚ is this. To [give] you the blessings so that you also are blessed as well as those people who'll meet you will be blessed‚ with Saubhagya.
Amruta Lakshmi‚ Amrut means the one that is the nectar. If you take that you will not die. Means eternity. So She's the one who gives you the life of eternity.
Gruha Lakshmi. Gruha Lakshmi is the deity of the family‚ the one who's the deity of the family. Now‚ any housewife need not be Gruha Lakshmi. She can be a shrew‚ She can be a horrid thing. The deity of the household‚ if She resides in you‚ then you are Gruha Lakshmi‚ otherwise you are not. Then there is Raja Lakshmi. She is the one who gives grace to the kings. If the kings behave like servants‚ then they are not called as kings. They have to behave in a dignified manner. The dignity‚ the majesty of the king comes from the Raja Lakshmi in him. But a Sahaja Yogi need not be trained. He walks very straight in a very stately manner. In his movements he's stately‚ he's very majestic in handling people. He's very gracious in doing anything in such a manner that people think‚ ""Oh‚ here comes a king.""
Satya Lakshmi. That is‚ that you get the awareness of Truth. But apart from that – the awareness of Truth is there – but to put the Truth forward in a gracious manner. Not to say ""Now this is the truth – have it!"" – Not like that! You don't have to hit people with the Truth‚ you have to put it in a flower and give it to them. That is Satya Lakshmi. Of course‚ all Lakshmi tattwas are the parasympathetic powers within us‚ but they are actually expressed in our brain. Brain is the Viraata – the Vishnu when He becomes the Viraat‚ the Aakbar. So all His powers – especially these powers – are in the brain. So‚ the brain itself spontaneously behaves in such a manner that people think that this is a special type of a personality.
Then you have got Bhogya Lakshmi by which you know how to enjoy. A Sahaja Yogi always knows how to enjoy everything. The Sahaja Yogi is never a worried type. Anything he can enjoy. Once‚ we climbed a very steep place‚ called Palithana. It was about 6 miles about‚ like that‚ as if walking for 6 miles. Climbed up. I reached there and saw the beautiful carvings. I was not tired at all when I saw the carvings. And I was telling my son- in-law‚ ""See every tail of the elephants is made differently."" He said: ""Mother I'm panting here. How can you see the tails of the elephant?"" It is because I can enjoy. You should be able to enjoy anything.
Yoga Lakshmi. The one who gives you Yoga. That power is within you. That is the power of Lakshmi within you – means you give others the yoga. Now when you give the power of yoga to others‚ I mean when you use your power of yoga‚ then you don't behave like a monkey or a donkey or a horse‚ but you do it with grace‚ do it in such a manner that it is very gracious. That is what you call bhadrata  ... in a gentle‚ dignified‚ majestic way. Gentle‚ dignified‚ majestic way – three words (in English) for one word (in Sanskrit). So this is what it is. And now when you have sung it in this manner‚ this power has been bestowed upon you. Now even if you want you cannot behave indecently. You are fixed! ",https://www.amruta.org/p/6987,Diwali,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10430,,,Third day - Shri Mahalakshmi ,It's the day of Mahalakshmi Puja night‚ not only of Lakshmi Puja; there's a difference between the two. Mahalakshmi is one of the three powers‚ main powers of Adi Shakti. As you know: Mahalakshmi‚ Mahasaraswati‚ Mahakali. Now these powers have powers at a material level also‚ at a subtler level also. So Mahalakshmi power is achieved after Lakshmi Power‚ as you know. ,https://www.amruta.org/p/100,Diwali,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10440,,,Third day - Shri Mahalakshmi ,Now I have to take you to a very subtler side of life and that subtler side is that with the blessings of Shri Lakshmi or Mahalakshmi now you have achieved your self realisation. The Mahalakshmi principle has given you this ascent and the Mahalakshmi principle is that you rise much above your mundane life into the realm of self-realisation. So by her blessings you become like lotuses yourselves. Now you become another aspect of Diwali which means the rows of lights.,https://www.amruta.org/p/41,Diwali,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10450,,,Third day - Shri Mahalakshmi ,Now the awareness that was seeking up to Lakshmi‚ means you achieve money‚ achieve position for achieving Grace. Once you have achieved the Grace of this‚ you want to achieve God. And this new awakening within you that you have to achieve God now‚ is the power of Mahalakshmi. By the power of Mahalakshmi only‚ you achieve your saintliness‚ your Realisation. That's why She came on this earth as the Mother of Jesus Christ. That was Mahalakshmi‚ not Lakshmi but Mahalakshmi. ,https://www.amruta.org/p/100,Diwali,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10460,,,Third day - Shri Mahalakshmi ,"So the first thing that Lakshmi gives you: the value system. Your value system is corrected. You evaluate yourself properly; like‚ you know the value of this and value of that and value of this. But the value system for a divine person is not based on the amount of money or amount of matter it has‚ but it depends on what vibrations it has. So the whole evaluation system changes when you get into divine temperament‚ that you start seeing things: what is precious is what has the maximum vibrations. Whatever has vibrations is the precious thing for a Realised soul. And not what is not divine. What is not divine‚ we have nothing to do. [  ...]
So your value system changes as your Mahalakshmi essence starts growing and manifesting. You stand absolutely open‚ and you find new things‚ new ideas‚ a new evaluation of everything starts up. Once this happens to you‚ know that you are growing. You must know how to judge whether you are growing or not‚ and that is how you will know that you are growing in the right direction – if your value system is in place. ",https://www.amruta.org/p/6789,Diwali,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10470,,,Third day - Shri Mahalakshmi,"You have got Mahalakshmi's powers within you‚ do you know that? [  ...] Power is what you do to others. The whole thing I told you just now. Is to purify. You have the power to purify. How do you cure people? By purifying them. All right? Now just think how you purify others‚ by talking to others you can purify them. By touching others‚ you can purify them. By looking at them‚ you can purify them. One person‚ who is a realised soul‚ purifies the whole atmosphere.
You all have those powers and you are not aware of them. This is the best part of it. You can't follow it. Now let's have it. [  ...] It quenches the thirst‚ the spiritual thirst. You can quench the spiritual thirst of people‚ tremendous power‚ because when you give realisation that seeking is over. All right? Then another one now come along. What other qualities? Think of the water‚ nourishment‚ you nourish. You give spiritual nourishment to people through your power; even if you are standing there you are nourishing others. Then dissolvement‚ you dissolve their ego and you dissolve their super ego. All these powers you own after realisation. Just think of it. [  ...]
It has another very great quality that water permeates into the smallest particle. It goes into the roots‚ I mean sucks into the roots. So Mahalakshmi power you just see the roots of the person. You just know where the problem comes from‚ just‚ actually it is the awareness‚ it is the intelligence‚ suck the truth part of it which gets enlightened. And you understand now where is the problem‚ you just go near the root and you suck and you can be easily sucked‚ you permeate. [  ...]
So the whole idea of celebrating today the Lakshmi's day is to understand that in us She has become the Mahalakshmi. By that we have so many powers of which we are not aware‚ I mean we do not know that we are realised souls. Some of us‚ we do not know and that we have those powers within us that we can permeate into others. We can project our personalities to others. We can find out what's wrong with them. We can find out about ourselves. We can go into ourselves‚ we can go into – our permeation is like water is moving‚ is flowing all the time. And this is a very important thing that we should be aware of: our powers that we have achieved. ",https://www.amruta.org/p/76,Diwali,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10480,,,Third day - Shri Rama's coronation ,Then the fifteenth night is the darkest night‚ that's the darkest night when there is no moon. Absolutely that's the day when they celebrate the Diwali. But symbolically in India also‚ Shri Rama returned to Dwarika. ,https://www.amruta.org/p/484,Diwali,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Shri Rama,,,,,,,,,,,,
10490,,,Third day - Shri Rama's coronation ,"But ""diwali"" word is from ""deepa wali""‚ means ""rows of lights"". It was celebrated firstly because thousands of years back Shri Rama was crowned on this day. That means the benevolence of human beings was crowned‚ was accepted. And in Shri Rama's life you see an ideal personality being shown to be a king‚ to be the benevolent king as described by Socrates. So this was a great joyous thing that a benevolent king was crowned. That means we have to have a king who is benevolent. That's only possible if the people who choose the king have no other consideration but that of benevolence of all the people. So one has to come to the conclusion that they have to be Sahaja yogis‚ because other think‚ ""How much money we'll get out of this power that we'll have."" Some think‚ ""How much power-oriented we could be."" Some think‚ ""How many countries I can win‚"" or any other domination. So we've got two types of theories: as we see‚ is one is communism and another is democracy‚ where one is power-oriented‚ the other is money-oriented‚ and in both the cases we say that it's all failed. ",https://www.amruta.org/p/4389,Diwali,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Shri Rama,,,,,,,,,,,,
10500,,,Third day - Shri Rama's coronation,So that is how the Bharatmilap‚ the meeting of Bharat and Shri Rama is celebrated‚ and that was the time He was crowned also as the king. So‚ it was a long time back‚ thousands of years back‚ this thing happened‚ that jubilation is very significant. That the right king gets His own throne and He rules and all injustices and all kinds of atrocities that He has gone through have to be completely finished from His life‚ and that's why Diwali is important. ,https://www.amruta.org/p/448,Diwali,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Shri Rama,,,,,,,,,,,,
10510,,,Third day - Shri Rama's coronation ,So one has to understand that it was the king‚ Rama‚ who was made the  ... actually accepted by the public‚ like a crown was put on his head to say that benevolence is the highest thing. And whatever is benevolent for us should be accepted in our freedom if we are really a free country. But if we are not free inside‚ we are bound by what people will say; they'll criticise us. Do you know as a result of that there is no art in this country. ,https://www.amruta.org/p/4389,Diwali,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10520,,,Third day - Shri Rama's coronation,Shri Rama's crowning or any other aspect of Shri Lakshmi here now becomes your own crowning‚ that is now you have entered into the Kingdom of God and once you are there then automatically as the citizens of God's Kingdom you are blessed. And as you become the lotuses then you start spreading your fragrance all around. Now you do not keep this joy to yourself but you become generous about it and you go all-out to give it to others. Generosity at another level‚ at a lower level is transformed into this universal love. Whatever you gain‚ whatever joy‚ satisfaction‚ vibrations‚ knowledge‚ all that you want to give it to others. You want to spread it because now you've got the reality and you don't want to keep it to yourself‚ you think it is very important that everyone in the world should know about reality.,https://www.amruta.org/p/41,Diwali,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10530,,,Third day - Birth of Jesus Christ,That is the time when Christ was born‚ that's why lights are lit just in the night because He was born at twelve o'clock in the night. ,https://www.amruta.org/p/100,Diwali,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10540,,,Third day – Shri Lakshmi puja (no moon day),"Two great powers are combined in Jesus Christ. The first power is that of Shri Ganesha‚ who is recognised as his original power‚ and the other is that of Shri Kartikeya. Because of this‚ the incarnation of Jesus Christ is of complete ""Brahman Tattva"" or ""Aumkar"". Shri Krishna‚ He being the father of Jesus Christ‚ bestowed a number of boons on Jesus Christ prior to his birth. One of these boons was that‚ ""You (Jesus Christ) would dwell on a plane higher than that of mine."" This could be explained to mean‚ that while the plane of Shri Krishna is the Vishuddhi Chakra‚ located at the base of our neck‚ the plane of Jesus is Agnya Chakra‚ which is located at the junction of the optic thalamus (pineal and pituitary glands). The second boon granted by Shri Krishna was that‚ ""You (Christ) would be the support of the whole universe"". The third boon was that ""You (Christ) would be the first to receive one-sixteenth part of all the offerings made to Me in Pooja"". In this way‚ after bestowing a number of boons‚ Shri Krishna permitted Shri Jesus Christ to incarnate on the earth. You would understand these things better‚ if you read ""Markandeya Purana"". Shri Markandeya‚ the author of the Purana‚ has beautifully explained a number of such subtler points. In the same Purana‚ there is a graphic description of Shri Maha Vishnu. If you would listen to this description while in meditation‚ you would notice that the description is of Jesus Christ only.
Now‚ if you study the etymology of the word‚ ""Christ""‚ you would know that the word has originated from a corrupted form of word‚ ""Krishna""‚ As a matter of fact‚ the father of Jesus Christ is Shri Krishna. That is why He is called ""Christ"". The manner in which his name ""Jesus"" originated is also very interesting. The mother of Shri Krishna‚ Shri Yashoda Mata; was addressed as ""Yesu"". Even today‚ we notice that in northern Indian somebody named ""Yeshu"" is not addressed as such but as ""Jesu"". It is therefore clear that from ""Yashoda"" came the word‚ ""Yeshu"" and then further became the word ""Jesu"" and finally the name ""Jesus Christ"".

10550,,,Third day – Shri Lakshmi puja (no moon day),He incarnates there as the embodiment of innocence. That's why He is such a powerful deity who incarnates and settles down in that area (Agnya chakra). His coming on this earth was very important because the ego and superego had crossed each other and there was no space for the Kundalini to pass through. That is the cross where He was crucified. And when He came on this earth‚ four thousand years before that‚ Shri Krishna described that the power which is divine cannot be destroyed. The Spirit cannot be destroyed‚ it cannot be burnt‚ it cannot be blown off. And that's why Christ had to come on this earth to establish that truth. ,https://www.amruta.org/p/6649,Diwali,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Christ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Innocence,,

Yogi: ""I don't know"".
Shri Mataji: Makes no difference. That's the first day of the moon. That is the forefather of your Mother‚ Shalivahana; they started a calendar‚ from that date. And so on the first‚ that means the first day of the moon‚ the New Year is celebrated. Now see symbolically Christ is born and the New Year is celebrated the next day. As soon as He is born New Year starts. So next year it starts: the New Year. That is a New Year in many parts of our country where Shalivahana lived. The Shalivahan was my forefather‚ I should say they were My  ... they were just a dynasty. And this dynasty ruled in India since very long. Even in the old puranas it is written that they helped Krishna in their war. You know all the story about Shalivahana quite a lot. And so the New Year started. So for us‚ that is the New Year‚ for Sahaj Yogis that is the New Year‚ you have to accept it. And your Mother is of that dynasty. I mean no force on you‚ but if you like you can have it.

10570,,,Fourth Day – Bali padwa (first day of the moon),"That is the calendar of My forefathers‚ because you're all My children you have to use the same calendar – Shalivahanas calendar – and that is the first day of the Shalivahanas calendar. And what do they do in the morning time to celebrate it? They take one of these jars‚ Aquarius and put a shawl with it and that is put as a flag‚ representing the Aquarius and the shawl of the Mother. That's why they are called as Shalivahana – the ones who carry the shawls of the Mother‚ the ""carriers of the shawls of the Mother"". That's how they put it up. The shawl on top of the Aquarius. This should be actually the flag of the Sahaja Yogis that you make it the Aquarius or we can say the jar [  ...we can call it kumbha  ...] and the shawl is there so they put it up. That's why they call as Gudi Padwa‚ Padwa means first day of the moon is Padwa‚ and Gudi means ""this"". So they put it up and that is how they say that today is the New Year day for the Shalivahanas. Shawl is the covering of your Mother which gives Her warmth and also it covers Her modesty. Shawl is a sign of regality and modesty and chastity. So you stand for that of your Mother. You protect it like Ganesha does. Only on one point He gets angry‚ if anybody says or does anything against the Mother‚ then He comes down. That's why Christ has said: ""Anything against Me I'll tolerate‚ but anything against the Holy Ghost‚ will not be forgiven."" That's the Son talking about the Mother‚ that's what happens.

10580,,,Fourth Day – Bali padwa (first day of the moon),"It's also the day of Gudi Padwa‚ on which we honor the sacred and harmonised relationship between the husband and wife‚ as well as between a father and his daughter. The love that you get from your husband or yourwife‚ settles down in every pore of your body. However‚ that love is just restricted to you and others don't get its light. If a mother loves her child‚ then the love is restricted only to the mother and her child. Sometimes‚ the result of this love is contrary to what we expect. If a mother loves her child more than that is necessary then sometimes the child can behave badly. His behaviour may become ""dry"" or even evil; he can trouble his mother or even insult her. If a child is too attached to his mother then she might possess him and sit on his head. In the same manner‚ it has been observed that if the love between a husband and wife goes out of balance or if the love is not shared appropriately between the two then the outcome is often ill. However‚ when the soft love of Sahaja Yoga is filled in the lamp of the heart‚ it is no longer restricted to oneself.

10590,,,Fifth Day – Bhau Bij (second day of the moon),So today is the second day. Second day is the Bija – they call it Bhav-bija‚ is the day when the brother and the sister‚ who are the seeds of one tree‚ have that pure exchange of affection. The sister does the aarti of the brother‚ gives him a tika and then brother gives her something as a token of his love‚ as a present. ,https://www.amruta.org/p/484,Diwali,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10600,,,Fifth Day – Bhau Bij (second day of the moon),Then the second day is also very important. [  ...] The moon came out of the sea. According to this mythology‚ the Lakshmi came out of the sea and with Her this moon came out‚ which was only a two-day-old moon‚ the new moon but a two-day-old moon‚ and this was regarded as the brother of Lakshmi‚ because they were born at the same time from the sea. ,https://www.amruta.org/p/100,Diwali,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10610,,,Fifth Day – Bhau Bij (second day of the moon),"[  ...] and that day is the day when all the sisters worship their brothers‚ very important. Raksha Bandhan Day they (sisters) give a symbolic expression to their desire that their brother should be good. But on this day they worship their brothers‚ actually worship them. They (brothers) are invited at home‚ they are made to sit on a special type of a seat [  ...] also Aarti is done to them. [  ...] But for a Gruha Lakshmi‚ the brother is very important. And the brotherhood and sisterhood is the base of our Sahaj Yoga collectivity. If you understand  ... that brotherhood and sisterhood is love which is very pure. There is no expectation‚ it's just love‚ it's giving love and taking love. And absolute purity within us should exist in our relationships when we call them as Sahaj Yogi brothers and sisters. And as there is understanding‚ complete understanding between the brother and sister in a family‚ one has to know we are all part and parcel of a family‚ born of the same Mother. Nobody has to shoot off – war; nobody has to become something great‚ nobody has to correct others‚ nobody has to say that ""I'm something unique."" All of you have to work it out together and find out the solution working out together in complete friendship and unison. Anyone who cuts himself off and goes out or becomes anything else‚ goes out of circulation is useless for Sahaj Yoga. Such a person is completely useless: the one who tries to get out of the family. All of you have to be supporting each other‚ helping to each other‚ not shouting at each other and getting angry with each other‚ trusting each other‚ not finding faults‚ treating each other with respect and love. [  ...]
This is the most important thing‚ if Sahaj Yogis don't understand that you are saints and you have to respect it. For example‚ you cannot doubt each other‚ you cannot‚ that's not allowed‚ it's prohibited. You are not to doubt each other. Be aware‚ I would say that if somebody slaps you on one cheek‚ turn the other. That you work out here. In this Sahaj Yoga one has to do it‚ not to criticize anyone‚ not to put down anyone. You are all Saints‚ why don't you recognize it? How can you insult a saint? You are ""Men of God‚"" do you realise that? How can you put down anyone and say ""they are not good"" and ""they are good""? If you start doing that‚ somebody else will take advantage of you and will really push you down and you will be in very great trouble. Never get into such funny ideas‚ that you are better than the others‚ that you can do better than the others. The one who starts doing the better is doing the greatest harm. There is no competition in Sahaj Yoga. Give up this idea of competition. You are brothers and sisters‚ you have to support each other‚ help each other. Anybody is going down‚ try to work out. If you find somebody is going down too much beat him with shoes. [  ...]
At the delicate point when Sahaj Yoga is coming up‚ you have to be much closer together. Later on when you are very powerful it's all right because you will have greater rapport. But it's such a vicious circle that at this time when you are weak you are also falling off. And this collectivity is all-embracing. Of course these are due to your ego‚ superego‚ whatever problems‚ but only together you are going to be  ... But I have seen when you are mesmerised‚ you are following again ego‚ absolutely. When you are mesmerised. But when there is freedom‚ you cannot enjoy your collectivity. In freedom people find it very difficult too – then somebody behaves like an ascetic‚ some behaves like a madcap‚ somebody behaves like a hot-tempered fellow‚ another behaves like a sitting consul‚ I don't know. When it is freedom you do not grow in a healthy way together. You must know there must be something within you which is keeping you out of collectivity. At this stage the best thing is to surrender and beat yourself with shoes. Any such ideas come into your head you just do that way‚ that's the way it will work out.

Left side is cured means left swadistana first of all. So many of you have been to so many gurus‚ this‚ that and have done wrong things. That gets corrected.

I'm fighting my own gurus‚ those who have taught me all the vidyas of the battleship‚ battle and also the vidya of archery. And I'm fighting my own cousins.""

That means if you say that you have to be responsible‚ then He says‚ ""All right go ahead‚ try."" But if you say that ""You are responsible. I am just an institution or an instrument in Your hand‚"" then you start manifesting it well and that is how your Vishuddhi chakra gets opened out.

In the same way‚ we have to worship the aspect of Shri Krishna in Me‚ which is Yogeshwara. I am Yogeshwara   ... so today we have to know that our personal life has to be extremely clean. We face ourselves every moment and find out within ourselves that – are we really worshipping Yogeshwara within ourselves‚ who resides within us? Let us develop that purity  .... Let us worship Yogeshwara with our heart.

When I see people‚ young people‚ doing all these things I wish they could under- stand the value of their lives‚ the esteem of their lives. Their Ishwara is Shri Krishna. He's not the Ishwara of everyone‚ only of yogis  .... He is only available to you. He is only your Ishwara. He manifests only for you. He is your own  .... So He is actually your own king‚ who is always there‚ looking after you. When you call Him‚ He comes with all His powers to support you. But you have to be a yogi.

Leeladhara is the one for whom this whole universe is a play. He is at the axis and for the whole periphery. It is nothing but a play  .... Except for your spirit everything is false. It's all a joke going on‚ you can say‚ a drama going on‚ nothing so serious. The spirit is the only truth within us – the rest is all untruth. There cannot be many types of truths you see.

He came to show us that it's all a leela‚ it is all the play of God. What is there to be serious? What is there to be ritualistic? You cannot bind God in any rituals. That's why He came on this Earth‚ to tell you that you should not try to bind yourself by rituals‚ which are nonsensical. This was His teaching so many years back. He taught this six thousand years back‚ but still‚ if you see every religion today‚ there are so many rituals going on.,https://www.amruta.org/p/7023,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10990,Playfulness / Leela,,She saw the whole universe moving in the Vishuddhi chakra,"In His childhood He was very fond of butter  .... He would go and make His friends help Him and make a pyramid out of them. He would climb up and break the butter container and would eat all that butter like a little baby. So one day His mother said‚ ""All right‚ why did you eat the butter?"" He said‚ ""I never ate it."" She said‚ ""Then what is this on your mouth?"" He said‚ ""This is what all these boys have put on my mouth."" You see‚ to Him‚ even telling such little‚ little lies was also a fun with the mother. He would go to that extent  ....
So He told her a lie. ""See now‚ these people have put it on my mouth. They have eaten all the butter and now I am the one you are catching!"" – you see. So she said‚ ""Really? Open your mouth."" So He opened His mouth and then She saw all this. [Shri Mataji points to the solar system which is part of the puja decoration backdrop] in the mouth. The whole universe moving in the Vishuddhi‚ the complete Vishuddhi chakra she saw and she just bowed to Him. Then He said‚ ""Why are you bowing to me?"" as if nothing has happened  ....
Now stealing is supposed to be bad   ... but He was stealing only the butter of His mother that she had made them. And He used to steal the butter of all the ladies who used to take it down to Mathura‚ where Kansa was ruling. This butter was eaten by all the rakshasas there and they were becoming very powerful. So He thought‚ ""Best thing is to go and eat all the butter so that these ladies won't be able to go and sell it.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/7054,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11000,Playfulness / Leela,,Enjoying the drama,"His mother came and she took one stick and she said‚ ""Now You have eaten all the butter."" So He said‚ ""I never ate any."" His whole face was filled with it. ""And these boys must have put something on My mouth because they have eaten everything."" ""So then say‚ let us see now‚ the whole day I work for your cows and‚ when I come home‚ you just trouble Me like this."" And then He said‚ ""Now‚ I am your foster son‚ that is why you are troubling Me like this."" And she started looking at Him and then He put His hands towards her‚ little hands‚ and He said‚ ""But I have kept some for you in my hand‚ though they have eaten everything."" And He put it in her mouth‚ so that all her temper went away and she just embraced Him to His heart. And that's how the whole thing ends up into a sweet drama.
When Krishna is awakened within us‚ we also can do all such dramas with each other and enjoy the frolics. Then we don't lose tempers‚ we don't get angry‚ we enjoy each other's personality very much.",https://www.amruta.org/p/387,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11010,Playfulness / Leela,,The play of a child,"In the case of Shri Krishna‚ it was a different phase because people had become extremely serious‚ very disciplined and were leading a life which was‚ we can say‚ over- dharmic. And this had put the people at a fixed level and they thought that ""If we are doing all these things every day then it's all right. We have reached the last."" So Shri Krishna had to come Himself. Shri Vishnu‚ came as Shri Krishna‚ to tell us about the ascent and that all this is just a play. But only a person who is a master of the play can do the play  .....
For His part‚ Shri Krishna arranged something in His lifetime in a very simple way‚ as a child. It looks‚ very childlike. Like when the Gopis were taking their baths‚ He hid their clothes – I mean Indian women are never fully nude‚ never – He hid their saris and all that and He could see their backs‚ this little boy. What is for a little boy? He's sitting on a tree and is trying to raise their Kundalini. They're coming out of the River Yamuna‚ which is being vibrated by Radha. Already there are vibrations‚ you see‚ raising their Kundalini. Then they are taking the water and He breaks their pitchers‚ from the back‚ which have also got vibrated water in them. So the vibrated water falls on the backs of these ladies and He tries to awaken their Kundalini. See the play of a child‚ how He tried to play in His childhood‚ just like a child  ....
His power was Radha‚ Radha – Ra‚ dha. ""Ra"" means energy. ""Dha"" means the one which sustains – Radha – so the ""Dha Re Di Dha Sa Ma‚"" as they say. In the same way‚ Radha – Ra Dha – the one who sustains the energy  .... So with Her powers‚ He could work out this alaahd to all the people with whom He was connected. So all the Gopas and Gopis who were with Him had to do rasa – Ra is energy‚ Sa means ""with"" – to dance with the energy that is Radhaji. He used to just play the flute and She used to dance. The energy used to pass through Her hands to all the other people and the Kundalini would be awakened. So this was another play that He had. So in the play only‚ He raised the Kundalini. But in modern times it's very difficult. It is not easy to raise Kundalinis in modern times in that way. I mean nobody will understand.",https://www.amruta.org/p/2321,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11020,Spontaneity,,Immediately spontaneous like Shri Krishna,Now what should the attitude be of a Sahaja Yogi towards taking decisions? One should understand this. It should be a spontaneous decision. You don't have to tally it with this‚ go there and find out – immediately‚ spontaneous like Shri Krishna who jumped inside the river. So in the same way‚ you should have a very spontaneous deci- sion for anything  .... A Sahaja Yogi has to decide everything absolutely spontaneously at that moment.,https://www.amruta.org/p/2349,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11030,Compassion,,,"In the life of Shri Krishna‚ you can see that He had a friend who was very poor and he wanted to meet Shri Krishna  .... When he went to Shri Krishna‚ Shri Krishna was in His palace and the people at the door said‚ ""No‚ you can't meet Him."" He said‚ ""All right‚ you just go and tell Him that Sudama has come.
He was sitting on the throne discussing something and He said‚ ""Sudama has come?"" He rushed out and went to the door and hugged him. Hugged him again and again and He said‚ ""Why are you standing here?"" He took him and put him on the throne and He told His wives‚ ""Please come and wash his feet."" Then they brought clothes for him. He had a bath. Shri Krishna made him sleep on His bed   ... and asked the ladies to fan him so that he wouldn't feel hot. See the compassion of Shri Krishna. It shows so beautifully. Are we that compassionate? There was no need for Him to do that because there had been no drama‚ nothing. But His heart – He took a spontaneous decision. When He had heard Sudama was there‚ He just rushed to him. He just felt so happy that ""My old friend has come  ....""",https://www.amruta.org/p/2349,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11040,Dharma,,He is the integrated form of all dharmas,"The greatest freewill comes from the Vishuddhi chakra‚ as I told you‚ and that is why we call Him Yogeshwara. He is the Ishwara of Yoga. The establishment of yoga is possible when you surrender yourself to Shri Krishna. Completely surrender yourself to Shri Krishna – your Yoga will be established. What does this mean? It means that your balance will be established. You go into complete balance because of Shri Vishnu‚ who is the incarnation for sustaining the dharma‚ who is responsible for giving you the balance and becomes complete in the form of Shri Krishna  ....
After Realization‚ you go beyond dharma  .... You are using the dharma first of all to establish yourself‚ but when you go beyond dharma into the state of Virat‚ then you don't need any dharma. You become the dharma of the Virat.
Now‚ what is the dharma of Virat? What is the dharma of Shri Krishna? It is collectivity. Shri Krishna is the brain. Shri Shiva is the heart and Shri Brahmadeva is the liver. Now what is the faculty of this brain? – that the tree of life‚ of evolution‚ grows downward‚ as Shri Krishna says. This tree is growing downwards from the awareness from the brain. But if you have to go to the roots‚ you have to ascend. And that ascent you have achieved. Now you have gone to the roots of your brain where all your roots are enlightened‚ all your nerves are enlightened‚ your brain is enlightened‚ you are an enlightened person. When you are in darkness you may catch hold of a snake as rope‚ but when you are in the light you will drop it. In the same way‚ when you become enlightened‚ your dharma is enlightened. You don't have to take to any guru or to any book or to anyone. You know yourself  .....
At the Vishuddhi chakra‚ you surrender all of your other dharmas. It means that it all gets sublimated. It all gets complete. The wholesomeness is achieved because He is col- lective being. He is the Virata because He is the integrated form of all the dharmas and He is the Virata in our brain. He represents our brain. When this Virata in us is awakened fully‚ then all the dharmas become natural with us. We don't have to do any dharmas. We don't have to be conscious of any dharmas‚ but automatically we become dharma ourselves.",https://www.amruta.org/p/4424,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11050,Dharma,,Dharma is an evolutionary process of human beings,What you have to do is to save the dharma – not the dharma that people talk about‚ but the dharma which means the evolutionary process of human beings‚ which is going on and‚ if all the good people who stand for righteousness are finished‚ then how will this evolutionary power will be saved? So you have to save them and for that‚ if you have to kill‚ you don't kill anybody. They are already dead because they are not evolved souls and they don't care for their Realization. So you have to fight them. You have to fight the negative forces. You have to fight the wrongdoers. All this He explains in a very beautiful manner‚ that we have within us three kinds of powers‚ which we also know‚ and by the middle one that we have‚ we rise above all these material‚ physical‚ mental‚ emotional‚ all these problems facing us‚ into a new realm of spirituality. And that's what He wanted to save from the cruel people‚ from the aggressive‚ those who were also misleading others. It's a very good understanding‚ if you have that. Who is your relation? Who is your brother? Who is your sister? Those who are evolved souls are your relations. They are your own and‚ for them‚ if you have to fight the people who are aggressive‚ you better do it. You have to do it. That is the way of dharma.,https://www.amruta.org/p/2340,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11060,Dharma,,You should only know what you owe to Me,"When Shri Krishna says ""surrender all these dharmas‚"" He is meaning to say ""you should only know what you owe to me"" – meaning the Divinity. Now today Shri Krishna is not here. It's Me who is Shri Krishna‚ so you must know what you owe to Me. I only changed My language. He used to take out His finger and to say that ""give up everything and sur- render everything to Me."" I don't do that way. I give a big lecture and bring you to a point.",https://www.amruta.org/p/4697,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11070,Dharma,,The building up of the spiritual sense is our work,It is natural to be a Sahaja Yogi. This is also built within us. For example‚ a seed is a seed. When it is a seed‚ we call it a seed. All right‚ naturally it is to be a seed‚ but then it sprouts and becomes the tree. So it is also natural in a seed that all that future‚ all the thousands of trees it is going to be‚ is also in that seed. Now as you know‚ they are experimenting that in one seed you can get a minimum of thousands of little‚ little sprouts in one seed which can all be made into trees or plants. This is a new thing that has come up. So when He said that you have to become a stitha pragya what He was trying to say was that – you should achieve your balance. Now He told that there was a war on. When they were warring‚ you have to do it. If you have to war with people‚ if you have to kill them it's all right. But afterwards‚ once that is over‚ then what you have to do is to build up your spiritual sense. Now the building up of the spiritual sense is our work and that is what we have to do – not only dharma.,https://www.amruta.org/p/1831,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11080,Witness state,,He creates drama‚ He acts in the drama and He is the spectator,"Shri Krishna is the one who is an expert of drama. He creates drama‚ He acts in the drama and He's the spectator also. In these three forms you should see yourself. You create the drama of yourself‚ ""Aha this one now‚ see now‚ how I'm acting here."" Then you become the spectator also  .... It is I think a more evolved state now than it was at the time of Shri Krishna because He talked only to one – Arjuna. Now I'm talking to thousands about this knowledge. At that time‚ He just talked about it at the time of war. I am talking at the time of peace. And it's much more evolved because Shri Krishna didn't give him Realization. But you have got the Realization. You've got the knowledge. You know everything. You have all the subtle ideas.",https://www.amruta.org/p/2321,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11090,Witness state,,Watch everything as a spectator,Like even if you think everything is a play‚ what happens is that your attitude towards it is like a spectator. You see the whole thing as a spectator. Like in a drama you sit down and you watch everything as a spectator‚ but you know what part is being depicted is a tragedy and what part is a comedy  .... You have a sense of discretion as to know what is a comedy and what is a tragedy. But if you are an actor‚ then to you it is not a comedy or a tragedy. It is a work for you. If you're acting‚ then you're acting and you are an actor.You're involved in it.,https://www.amruta.org/p/7229,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11100,Witness state,,Standing on the shores‚ just watching the waves move,"What happens really is that inside you you become a witness. You become a wit- ness in the sense that all that is disturbing‚ all that is troubling you‚ all that is a problem‚ you just start watching it‚ you start witnessing it‚ you start seeing it and you do not get disturbed. That seeing‚ that witnessing state has a tremendous power. Whatever you see without thinking‚ your problems get solved. Any problem you have‚ once you get this witness state – what you call tatasth‚ which means you are standing on the shores and watching the waves move – then you know how to solve the problems  ....
First get Self Realization and then be aware of your position. Then you will be surprised how you develop proper attention and proper understanding. Absolutely‚ it is an easy thing to do as soon as you find that you have achieved that witness state. So please try to make yourself a witness. When you see something‚ go into thoughtless awareness. That is your fort. Don't think. See the beauty that is there just pouring in. Just watch how these trees are standing still just watching you all. See – absolutely still‚ nothing is moving. They don't allow even one leaf to move. Let it be. Until the breeze starts‚ Mother starts the breeze‚ until we will just keep quiet and watch.",https://www.amruta.org/p/7023,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11110,Witness state,,As a yogi‚ your state of mind should be ethereal,"He was a sakshi which means that He had the capacity of witnessing the whole world as a play  .... Now this capacity in Him to witness has to be seen in every yogi. The element He controls is ether. We call it as akasha in Sanskrit. This ether‚ as you know‚ we are using now for our television‚ for our radio‚ for every sort of a collective work. So we have to be in charge of the ether element‚ as yogis. And that is the subtlest of all‚ in the sense that you permeate into everything with that  .... The negativity cannot enter into ether. When you enter into your ethereal zone‚ you actually enter into the area which is thoughtless awareness. So to achieve your ethereal state‚ you have to expand your thoughtless awareness. The sustenance of that is done by Christ‚ by the spirit.
So you can realize now as a yogi that your state of mind should be ethereal. And what should be the state of your superego? This is the ego part of it‚ that you should be in the ethereal state‚ and‚ as a superego‚ you should see it as a play. You should see the play of the negativity. Negativity will run away‚ but don't get involved into it‚ don't play into their hands. Then the negativity will separate from you. So the ego and superego both rise from the Vishuddhi chakra. They can be receded from the Agnya chakra‚ but are to be sucked in the Vishuddhi.",https://www.amruta.org/p/2509,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11120,Witness state,,I am the sakshi of the whole world,"You are not only in joy‚ but you know the truth. You know the absolute truth. And this absolute truth is the one that makes you understand what is right‚ what is wrong and you develop your wisdom‚ not your intellect so much. You then see your intellect misbehaving sometimes‚ telling you negative ideas‚ sometimes too much of aggressive ideas. You can become a witness‚ sakshi‚ and that's what Shri Krishna has said. ""I am the sakshi of the whole world‚ the witness of the whole world."" See‚ you can go on talking about Him‚ but what we have to see is where are we going wrong and how can Shri Krishna save us – not by singing‚ ""Hari Rama‚ Hari Krishna‚"" like that. By becoming‚ day by day‚ a wiser person. Wisdom gives you definite ideas as to how you have to be.",https://www.amruta.org/p/1831,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11130,Virata,,The power of the Virat becomes so tremendous‚ it acts globally,"The Vishuddhi chakra is where Shri Krishna resides‚ but when He rises to your Sahasrara‚ when He rises to that level‚ then He becomes the Virata. So the Virata's chakra is placed in the head above the Agnya and this Virat is the form of Shri Krishna who has risen above the Agnya. When you have risen above the Agnya‚ you become a part and parcel of Virata's land‚ we can say‚ because unless and until you are above your ego‚ you are still involved with yourself and with wrong ideas of maryadas. But when you rise above that and you become the Virat‚ the great‚ then you are in the land of the Virata. And the Virata's powers are tremendous‚ as was seen by Arjuna – the form of the Virat. The power of the Virat becomes so tremendous that it acts globally. It acts in such a manner that you sit here and anywhere it can act  ....
The power of the Virata is that it can penetrate into the subtle side of human beings in such a manner that everything we are is connected. We are not separated and every drop is connected with the ocean. We are connected with the whole universe. And when you become a citizen of the Virat‚ then all the things with which you are connected also get your vibrations‚ your ideas‚ your ambitions. Everything passes through that and it works. You have seen how many miracles have taken place in your lives. It is the Virata Shakti that works.",https://www.amruta.org/p/4382,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11140,Virata,,Doubtless awareness,"The last is the Virat. That is the state you have to reach  .... Once you get into the Virata‚ then all your ideas of separating or differentiating go out. You do not have any more ideas of races left‚ of nationality‚ of your city‚ of your village or anything. At that stage‚ you don't belong to any place. You belong to every place and you don't belong to every place  .... Nothing bothers you because you are in the Virata state. Because everything is absorbed by the Virata   ... you do not feel anything. Whatever sort of person you may be‚ you do not feel it. The Virata has to suffer‚ not you‚ and that is what is the best state where I want all of you to reach and to become absolutely free. Nothing can impress you. Nothing can influence you‚ nothing can dissuade you‚ but you stand on your self esteem and understanding about yourself‚ that you are a Sahaja Yogi and that you are connected with this power and you are a citizen of the Kingdom of God  ....
The whole attention should move like that. ""This is not only mine. It is everybody's. It belongs to everyone. Everybody has a right."" – that sort of a thing. When it starts growing from the individual‚ what we call vestiti tu sumestiti in Sanskrit‚ which is from individual to collective. Such a personality is then the most effective one for any kind of collective work  .... I find that still there are people who do not understand that they have to rise above the Vishuddhi chakra. If they do not ascend over the Vishuddhi they can never be proper Sahaja Yogis. They will always be half-baked. So we must try to rise above the Vishuddhi‚ the discretion part‚ then at that point we can never doubt Sahaja Yoga. We can never doubt and that's how the doubtless awareness can come to us.",https://www.amruta.org/p/2311,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11150,Virata,,Egoless intelligence‚ the pure intelligence,Ultimately‚ Shri Krishna becomes the brain. That's what I told you‚ that the fat of the stomach goes into the brain. So Shri Narayana enters into the brain and becomes what we call as the Virat‚ Akbar. When He becomes Akbar‚ then He is the brain in the big macrocosm. He is the brain‚ so people who worship Shri Krishna become brainy people without ego. Their brain develops and they have no ego about it. Egoless intelligence‚ which I call as the pure intelligence‚ starts manifesting.,https://www.amruta.org/p/7054,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11160,Virata,,Virata Shakti: the sense of collective consciousness,"The other thing that we have to understand is Shri Krishna at this stage of Sahaja Yoga‚ that it is the Virata Shakti that is manifesting at this time and not the Shri Krishna Shakti which was at His time. The power that is working here is no more that of Radha or of Mary‚ but of Viratangana. That's why the knowledge of Sahaja Yogis is much wider than the knowledge of all the saints of all the ages. But it is not deeper than them. If you can deepen your knowledge‚ this wider knowledge will have proper roots within you. So the brain is the roots. Here are the roots of the whole tree of life. Actually the Kundalini comes up and waters the brain first so that the whole tree of life is drenched in the divine bliss and divine knowledge.
So this Virata Shakti that we have to work out gives us the sense of collective consciousness first. First we understand it through our brain power. But the whole brain power is to be guided by the heart. It is to be watered‚ but in Sanskrit it is a very beautiful word – sinchena‚ like dewdrops you see‚ sprayed with the love of God. So the integration of this brain has to be with your heart and with your liver. Then only the Virata Shakti takes another form. The weapons of killing become the weapons of forgiveness. Every sort of destructive power is used for the construction‚ as if it is tricked.
Like now I told them a trick‚ how to trick these gurus. The power that they have can be tricked against them‚ as He said that their teeth must be put into their necks‚ into their throats. Instead of taking out their teeth‚ it is better to put them back into their own throats. And if you can do that‚ then there is no problem as far as their effect is concerned because you are more powerful and more tricky.",https://www.amruta.org/p/2509,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11170,Virata,,Viratangana Shakti: the power of maturity up to the fruit,"The Virata Shakti has now taken that form   ... so you are the fruits‚ that Viratangana Shakti. Because you are so valuable‚ those people who wanted to ruin or to destroy the Divine Power from this Earth will start thinking that they have to gain something out of these fruits  ....
You have to become that. The biggest thing one has to know is to bend down towards the Mother Earth‚ to be humble. Absolutely‚ the humility inside out is really going to give you the complete value of Sahaja Yoga fruits  .... Only fruits which bend down are accepted as good and matured fruits and not those who assert that they are the highest  .... But the matured fruit shows its humility by its weight. That is the Guru Tattwa – weight. So from the Viratangana power we get the power of maturity up to the fruit and then we become blessed by the Guru Principle.",https://www.amruta.org/p/2509,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11180,Sweeteness,,Madhura Shakti: when the fruit becomes sweet,"Those who are still involved in getting to better sunshine or getting to a better water supply or all these things that have not yet matured because the fruit doesn't need anything any more. It doesn't need anything from the Mother Earth nor from the elements. But it surrenders‚ it bends‚ it bows to the Mother Earth. So the Sahaja Yogi who goes on asking questions to Mother‚ bringing personal problems‚ stupid ideas‚ negativity‚ all those people are still not yet the fruits. The matured people are those who surrender‚ who bow to the Mother Earth. So the capacity to bow is the best judgment of yourself and leaving everything to the power of the gravity of your Mother to do every work for you and leaving all your small little worries behind.
You have to rise above these restricting powers and achieve the completion of this Virata Shakti‚ which ultimately becomes a Madhura Shakti – madhura. There is no word in the English language‚ but it means ""a sweet power."" Like the fruit becomes sweet. That's how you all have to become very sweet. Shri Krishna tried to make everything very sweet in the sense it was all Madhura Shakti that was acting‚ all His play‚ all His dancing. All His stories‚ if you read‚ it is nothing but Madhura Shakti towards the Gopas and Gopis‚ towards other Sahaja Yogis. So you have to keep your Mother pleased by pleasing all other Sahaja Yogis and not other people.",https://www.amruta.org/p/2509,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11190,Sweeteness,,Sweet like honey,"To know the technique and the trick of the technique is also another meaning of yoga – yukti  .... First is that His character was madhuriya‚ meaning the sweetness. We always say‚ ""He's sweet like honey."" So when He talked to anyone or He com- municated with anyone‚ it was through sweetness. And this communication‚ if you have not developed it‚ then you are nowhere near yoga. Everything is madhuriya for Him‚ His talking‚ His actions‚ His face. Everything is madhuriya. So the second trick is how to master your own temper and the third one is how to master the temper of others. That's even better.",https://www.amruta.org/p/2321,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11200,Sweeteness,,The principle of communication,"The first principle is how you communicate with others. Start it at home with your children‚ with your wife‚ with your husband‚ how you communicate. Are you gentle? Are you kind? Are you dominating or aggressive? Just try to find out. It can go to any limit this aggressiveness‚ for either the women or the men  .... In My experience‚ I've seen the women are very dominating. In India men are extremely dominating‚ but here I find the women are. Now the basics as human beings is that you should have good manners  ....
Now how must you communicate? Decently‚ with very tender and very beautiful mannerism you have to talk to another person‚ talk to other Sahaja Yogis‚ talk to any- one. In a very sweet manner you should talk. I do not mean the French style‚ bending your body and all artificial stuff – not that. I am saying that if you are naturally talking to somebody‚ you should talk with decent language‚ with decency‚ with humility and need not go on jabbering all the time and talking too much. There's no need. But on the contrary‚ this was the style that was Shri Krishna. In short‚ His power was madhuriya‚ which is the sweetness‚ like the honey. When you are worshiping Shri Krishna you have to know that you must talk in a manner that will please another person.",https://www.amruta.org/p/1831,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11210,Sweeteness,,The peace should be with your brothers and sisters,"The peace within expresses‚ first of all‚ the peace with others. This is the first sign of the manifestation of peace. Such a person doesn't use harsh words‚ does not use cruel words. But he is also not a person who is ineffective. He is very effective‚ using very sweet and nice words. Maybe he begins by using harsh words‚ then he mellows down and comes down to a position where he is effective as well‚ as he is very mild and sweet. Such a personality has to be developed outside.
So the peace should be with your brothers and sisters. They are all born out of my Sahasrara and nobody has the right to insult‚ to be sarcastic. Saying things which are harmful. That is not friendship. It is a kind of very subtle enmity that you are carrying on in your hearts that cannot be forgiven. If you say sarcastic things to others‚ you are not in the culture of universal religion. You should be respectful. The more respectable you are to each other‚ the better will be.",https://www.amruta.org/p/11524,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11220,Sweeteness,,Diplomacy is for the benevolence of the spirit,"What is the essence of diplomacy? It is benevolence. You have to achieve the benevolence of the whole of humanity. This is the essence of it. If you are doing it‚ you are not doing it for yourself‚ for your own gain. You are not doing it for the gain of any particular person‚ but you are doing it for the benevolence of the whole of humanity. So once you know that this is the essence‚ what is the need to shout? By shouting you are not going to achieve anything.
So discipline doesn't mean something very dominating of one person or two per- sons. Discipline means that whatever we do has to be for the benevolence of your spirit and the spirit of others. This is what is the Sahaj discipline‚ where you do everything for the benevolence of others and for the benevolence of your own ascent. Once you have established this idea of hita‚ of this benevolence‚ you have known the life of Christ‚ the life of Mohammed‚ the life of all these great people.",https://www.amruta.org/p/7054,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11230,Discretion,,Once you are in the realm of divine discretion you cannot commit mistakes,His specialty was to create discretion in you  .... At this juncture‚ when we are facing a sort of a challenge of this new millennium‚ that the whole world is going to be destroyed and all those things people are talking about‚ it is really very important to know that‚ through discretion‚ what is good and what is bad  .... Once you are in the realm of divine discretion you cannot commit mistakes – even if you want to do it.,https://www.amruta.org/p/4382,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11240,Discretion,,Discrimination on vibrations,He gives us the gift of discrimination. That is His style‚ I should say‚ to teach you how to discriminate and then you will become experts on discrimination‚ on vibrations. On vibrations you can get everything so clearly‚ so beautifully. Others may not agree with you‚ that's a different point‚ but you know what is right and what is wrong and that is what Shri Krishna's gift is.,https://www.amruta.org/p/2340,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11250,Discretion,,Divine discretion,"We come to the point of the Virata. Before that‚ we have to cross the Hamsa. Without that‚ you cannot reach the Virata. So the Hamsa‚ as you know very well‚ is the discretion‚ the divine discretion‚ which must be within you  .... With this discretion‚ absolutely you have a complete understanding as to what has to be done and what is not to be done and‚ if that is established‚ a discretion is established. In many Sahaja Yogis‚ I must say‚ discretion has come even with their left Vishuddhi. Even if they have left Vishuddhi‚ they have this discretion. They know what is right and what is wrong. With that divine discretion‚ the first thing that happens is that people get impressed by you. It's real collectivity. It impresses the collectivity  ....
This is a very important point that one has to know‚ that while introspecting your- self just see if you have developed this quality of divine discretion or not. For example‚ there are many I have seen who‚ when they come to the program‚ they come and tell Me‚ ""Mother‚ some Sahaja Yogi told me that 'You have a bhoot.' Have I got a bhoot in me?"" I said‚ ""Not at all. How can there be any bhoot in you?"" He may be having‚ but the divine discretion is not to tell him just now‚ but to remove it.",https://www.amruta.org/p/2311,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11260,Discretion,,Shri Krishna and Shri Jesus Christ at the Hamsa chakra,"This Hamsa chakra is the one that‚ as if it has not gone up to the Agnya‚ but is holding on certain threads or certain parts of the Ida and Pingala. And they start flow- ing through your nose‚ expressing through your eyes‚ from your mouth and from your forehead. So you know that the Vishuddhi chakra has got sixteen petals‚ which look after the eyes‚ nose‚ throat‚ tongue‚ teeth. But the expression part of it comes through the Hamsa chakra  ....
On one side‚ we have the help of Shri Krishna to give us the discretion and‚ on the other side‚ we have Christ. In between is placed this Hamsa. So we have two great incarnations within us who are the embodiment of discretion. One side is Shri Krishna‚ who is the one who looks after the conditioning side of it. And on the other side is Christ who starts looking after the ego side of it.",https://www.amruta.org/p/3903,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11270,Discretion,,Hamsa chakra expresses auspiciousness in our awareness,"Hamsa chakra is a very pivotal centre‚ which expresses auspiciousness in our aware- ness. That means if this centre is alert and awakened‚ then we immediately know what is auspicious and what is not auspicious. We can say that we get the divine discretion.
I think it is a part of the genetics that people have discretion between good and bad‚ destructive and constructive. It basically has to be there. But we can easily spoil it by all these organs which are collective‚ the conditionings and the ego from outside. That is why this centre is very vulnerable. Other centres are not so much connected to the outside as this centre is connected. It receives all the information from all these organs. For example‚ the eyes are very important because they say they are the window of the spirit and you have seen that when the Kundalini rises and the spirit starts shining there is a dilatation of the pupils. You look like an innocent child and there is a twinkle in your eyes  ....
What happens really is this: our eyes can be a very good door for all kinds of bhoots to enter into our spirit and‚ when you start projecting it back‚ the same bhoots can pass into another person and can create the same kind of vacuum or same kind of vulnerability in the Hamsa chakra of other people. So that's why eyes have to be very‚ very clean‚ innocent.",https://www.amruta.org/p/2555,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11280,Destruction,,,"People do not know the other side of Shri Krishna. It's a play‚ all right. But He is Samhara Shakti. He is the power of destruction. It's very good that He is there‚ as He comes with everything to protect us. He has also got Sudarshan chakra. Sudarshan – su means auspicious. Darshan"" is vision. He gives us auspicious visions‚ you see. If you try tricks with Him‚ that goes around your neck and then you have auspicious darshans of yourself‚ that you are hanging in the air somewhere  .... But when Krishna was born‚ He was born in the most horrifying circumstances. The same is the case of Sahaja Yogis today. It's a thing of great joy and jubilation‚ no doubt‚ that He came and He gave us His Vishuddhi power‚ but we must understand that we are born in a very precarious time. I've been saying this so many times. There's not only one Kamsa there. So many are there. There is a big fight going on‚ in that you people are here in charge. You are the ones employed by God. You are the ones who have been given this great work. You have powers like Shri Krishna.",https://www.amruta.org/p/2355,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11290,Destruction,,He does not believe in forgiveness,"Shri Krishna's star is Saturn‚ Kshni. They say that if He gets after somebody‚ then nobody can be saved  .... This Saturn of Shri Krishna   ... is a quality within us that‚ sup- posing if somebody troubles us or does something‚ we don't have to do anything. Now this Shri Krishna policy‚ this Shri Krishna's nature‚ will work it out. It will inform this all-pervading power and‚ through that‚ this man or this woman or this party or this organization which is trying to trouble us will be hounded while we will be just sitting doing nothing. They will be just hounded until they jump in the sea. Automatically it will happen. But you have to know that you have the powers of Shri Krishna‚ by which‚ if He gets after someone‚ then nobody can save them. He is the last one who plays around‚ but He doesn't forgive. He doesn't believe in forgiveness. He says‚ ""Now‚ you had enough of it."" He gives a big‚ big long rope to hang yourself‚ but He never forgives. One thing is for definite – He never forgives. As you must have seen in the Mahabharata – His own judgment of things‚ which He doesn't forgive. He says‚ ""You have to pay. You have to pay for it except when you transcend.""
If you become a Sahaja Yogi‚ if you have transcended the Vishuddhi‚ then He cannot do anything like that to you. But if you have not‚ if there's no ascent‚ you cannot be saved. You cannot be saved from Him.",https://www.amruta.org/p/2311,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When He became the king He wanted   ... to establish people in dharma and He needed the help of the five elements. So He made them into five ladies whom He married. So He has five wives‚ but they are five elements‚ part and parcel of His being. But He was Yogeshwara‚ absolutely detached in His yoga‚ but He had‚ for practical purposes we can say‚ five wives. And there were sixteen thousand women who became His wives. These sixteen thousand women are nothing but His sixteen thousand powers because you know His chakras have got sixteen petals and these sixteen petals multiplied by the Virata's one thousand petals each – so it comes to sixteen thousand powers. So these sixteen thousand powers were incarnated as women‚ were taken away by some horrible king and He went there‚ fought this king and brought these ladies.
So He had to marry all of them – so-called marriage – and these sixteen thousand powers stayed with Him – by which He established our Vishuddhi chakra.",https://www.amruta.org/p/7054,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11320,About marriages and family,,A place in the heart of Shri Krishna,"Once it happened that the ladies who were married to Shri Krishna got very jealous of Radhaji and they told Shri Krishna that ""You don't love us."" On top of that‚ Shri Narada came to put more oil on the fire‚ that he said. ""He really‚ I believe‚ He never cares for you. He just likes Radhaji. He is not bothered."" So Shri Krishna‚ as diplomatic as He was‚ He started saying‚ ""Oh God‚ I have a terrible pain in my stomach. Now what to do?"" So they said‚ ""Now what to do?"" He said‚ ""It is very simple. You know anyone who is my bhakta [devotee]. If you can give the dust of your feet to Me to eat‚ then I will be all right."" So they got a fright of their life‚ you see.
As it is‚ if I tell you anything‚ you just want to give your solutions every time. Nobody listens to Me. If I say go here – ""No‚ no‚ it is better to go that way."" ""Come here."" ""No‚ no‚ this way is better."" Everybody has a brainwave about it. It does not matter. So there they had brainwaves. They said‚ ""You see‚ why don't you take some medicine?"" Then somebody said‚ ""We will call the Vidya."" He said‚ ""No‚ I know for definite that I cannot be cured by anything else but one thing‚ that you have to get the dust of one of my bhaktas and I will eat."" So everybody started looking at each other‚ as some of the Sahaja Yogis do when it comes to paying. They never heard it. Some of them never heard – better. You see‚ it is a very tricky nature. So they said‚ ""Now what to do? If we do not cure Shri Krishna‚ He is just wailing and what to do?"" Shri Krishna said‚ ""Have some pity on Me. Give Me some dust of your feet."" So He said to Narada that ""You go and ask Radha to send the dust of Her feet.""
So he went to Shri Radha. Shri Radhaji was in Vrindavan and the soil of that place is yellowish in colour like Keshar‚ like saffron. So he went and told that ""Shri Krishna is very sick. He has got a terrible pain in His stomach."" She got a fright. She said‚ ""Really? How can that be? I cannot believe it. So what does He say? What treatment can He take?"" ""He says anyone of His disciples‚ anybody of His bhakta‚ if they send a little of the dust of their feet‚ He will be all right. He has to take that as a medicine."" So She said‚ ""All right‚ take the dust of My feet."" He was amazed. He said‚ ""What are you doing? You understand if you give Him the dust of Your feet‚ then all your punyas [merits] will be lost. He is playing some trick‚ you know. Just don't try this thing."" She said‚ ""Nothing doing‚ you better take it."" But he said‚ ""What about Your punyas and papas?"" She said‚ ""I know one thing. It is He who looks after My papas and punyas. I have not to think about it."" So he took the dust of Her feet‚ which was absolutely yellow like a saffron or like a pollen of the flower and he went and gave it to Shri Krishna. Shri Krishna said‚ ""I knew Shri Radha would send‚ Now let me eat it."" He said‚ ""You can eat‚ but You have to answer the question that Shri Radha has said‚ that You look after Her papas and punyas. How is it? How can it be? What does that mean that you know what is punya and what papas are and She is not bothered about it? She has not to worry about Her papas and punyas."" He said‚ ""All right‚ now let me take the medicine."" He took the medicine and He said I better sleep. And Shri Narada saw the heart of Shri Krishna opened and in the heart was the lotus of a very beautiful pink colour. On that lotus was lying Shri Radhaji and Her feet were rubbing against the pollen of that lotus and the yellow of the Vrindavan clay was the same colour as that. And then he realized that when She is touching that lotus with Her feet‚ what does it matter if She gives the dust of Her feet to Shri Krishna to take. She is in His heart. When Her feet are in His heart‚ what does it matter? And that is how they realized that Shri Radha's love was so great that‚ for Her‚ She did not think of dharma and adharma‚ but just to be at the command of Her Lord.

Your relationships with other people‚ whether it is your sister or a brother or any other woman or any other man‚ there should be complete purity. And this is extremely important  ....

11370,Ocean of joy,,All these joys put together are Nirananda,Where there is complete joy‚ there is no happiness and unhappiness. You don't feel happiness or unhappiness. These are the qualities of the ego and superego. In Sahaja Yoga‚ as you grow from one to another‚ there are different types of anandas. Like we can say‚ the Spirit‚ when you see the Spirit‚ you get an anand called swananda. That means you feel your Spirit yourself and you feel very happy. Then you give Realization to others. You get parananda‚ the joy of others. But when you get the enjoyment of well-being‚ in health and materially all right and everything all right‚ everything in santosha. In complete satisfaction‚ then it's Brahmananda. And like that‚ you start feeling higher and higher joys within yourself because your nerves start opening to new dimensions. So you can say that at the Krishna level‚ you get Krishnananda‚ where you get the sweetness‚ the madhuriya. And when you see your generosity‚ then you get Shivananda. And when you are with children‚ you get Ganeshananda. And that can be described. All those can be described‚ but Niranand cannot be described‚ because it is Mahamaya's joy. All these joys put together are Nirananda. So there is no place for ego and superego at all. The complete Sahasrara is opened out and nothing but the complete rapport is established with the Divine. And there is a pouring of light all the time in the head and the light going back‚ that you have seen in My photograph‚ as if the Sahasrara becomes like a sucking child from the Universal Mother‚ sucking the joy inside and it is again reflecting back. It would be like the waves reach the shores and then they are again repelled. They go back and then they form a pattern. Now the joy out of that pattern‚ how can you describe? The only thing about Nirananda is that you have Mahamaya so close and so far away. That is the speciality. Completely thoughtless‚ silence there. Complete silence – you don't think. It's just silence you cannot put into words any more because the words break with the force of the ananda.,https://www.amruta.org/p/387,Shri Krishna Puja,Nirvichara Samadhi,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But until and unless Sahaja Yoga is completely manifested within us‚ the people who respect Sahaja Yoga will not continue to do so. That is why it is essential that we look inside of us. The nature of Shri Krishna is that we look inside of us and see what are the things that put us in trouble. We should find that out. We should look towards ourselves‚ within ourselves and that is not such a difficult thing. When we want to see our face‚ we look in the mirror. Similarly‚ when we need to see our spirit‚ we should find out how to see it within us. Many Sahaja Yogis have asked Me‚ ""Mother‚ how do we see what is within us and how we are doing?"" For that‚ it is necessary that we ourselves should become very humble.

I am very happy that you kept today's puja. Shri Krishna's Puja will take place and a lot of people will get cleansed from within because this is a special blessing of Shri Krishna.

11430,About Introspection,,I have given siddhis to all of you,"For a Sahaja Yogi‚ it is to witness himself first of all. That is the introspection. He should see for himself‚ ""Where was I and I have come here."" Don't indulge too much in the past‚ but see the distance you have crossed in such a short time. Now you have come into the Kingdom of God. You have all the powers. I don't tell lies. It is a fact  ...
See for yourself how many powers you have got. Now‚ with your Left Vishuddhi‚ you will always conclude‚ ""Oh‚ how can I have any powers? After all‚ I have done this‚ I have done that  ...."" Because that‚ the left Vishuddhi is all the time telling you that you are good for nothing. It's like a leaking hole in your brain that takes away all the sense. And you accept it  ....                                                                                                                 You know what you can do. You also know that whatever you say happens. What- ever you want‚ you can get it. Try‚ try‚ try‚ but if you don't do it‚ then you will be all the time half-baked. Take the experience of your powers. See how dynamic you are. Don't have formalities about it  .... I have given siddhis to all of you. I never discriminate‚ but it's only He that is very brave. He uses left and right. If you do not use your siddhis‚ what can I do? I've given you all the siddhis. No doubt about it. So try  ....
Have faith in yourself. If you have left Vishuddhi‚ this Vishnumaya won't work out. But be like Vishnumaya. Just give up this guilt. ""No‚ I am a Sahaja Yogi. I'm not an ordinary person.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/2311,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11440,About Introspection,,So now I have to improve   ...,"Another style of this left Vishuddhi is this‚ which one must understand‚ that it tries to give an explanation. As I told you many a time‚ you tell somebody telephone to someone. First they will say‚ ""He may not be there‚ Mother."" ""Baba‚ you telephone. First find out if he may be there or may not be there."" But they would not. They would just avoid and that is another thing. Vishnumaya never avoids. You have seen that. Once She has to shine‚ She shines‚ wherever She is‚ whatever She is. So in the same way‚ we have to be like that. We have to know that we are special people‚ we are chosen‚ we are angelic and that we   ... have entered into the Kingdom of God and it will all work out. Sahaja Yoga is not meant for useless people. As I told you in Marathi‚ Tukaram has said‚ ""Eddia gabalache kam nave"" – It's not meant for lunatics and lousy people. It's meant for somebody who has thiala pahije jatiche. You need people of character. I know that there cannot be many like that‚ but there is no place in God's realm for many people‚ for all these useless people. It's only for something special. These seats are reserved and you have got your Realization now‚ somehow. So now try to understand that this Vishnumaya principle has to be expressed and has to be shown and you introspect yourself‚ ""Have I done that or not?"" Don't be afraid that they say that ""Our ego will come up."" It doesn't matter. You will also see your ego. This is the second part of Shri Krishna's play‚ that in this Krita Yuga you see your ego.
Now the third situation is that you accept whatever is wrong with you. If you do not accept‚ then you have not been kind to yourself. That is the central part of it‚ that you must accept‚ ""Yes this is the wrong. This is something wrong with me. I have gone in this part   ... or that part. I'm wrong. So now I have to improve.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/2311,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11450,Wisdom,,Wisdom is a temperament. It is a quality of a personality which comes to you by balancing yourself,If you are awakened by Shri Krishna's powers‚ then the first thing that should happen to you is wisdom. Now the wisdom is something you cannot describe. You cannot say what is wisdom. It's very difficult to describe it or to delimit it. Wisdom is a temperament. It is a quality of a personality which comes to you by balancing yourself‚ by a trial and error method. All traditional countries innately have much more wisdom than people who are not traditional. But Krishna broke all the traditions. That's why you people are here without much tradition. He broke all the traditions‚ but He was Shri Krishna‚ so He did not need any tradition at all. But for you‚ you have to understand from the people who have tradition what is wisdom. So we do a trial and error. We make mistakes‚ from that we learn.,https://www.amruta.org/p/7229,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11460,Wisdom,,The light of the spirit‚ which shines through your Hamsa chakra‚ gives you wisdom,"The light of the spirit‚ which shines through your Hamsa chakra‚ gives you wis- dom. Wisdom doesn't mean that you know how to argue things or you fight with people. No‚ it doesn't mean that. Wisdom means how you take to the good side of everything to enjoy it. This is wisdom and that you avoid all destructive things and take to something constructive  ....
You start enjoying every aspect which is supposed to be very‚ very bad for oth- ers. To you‚ you know the aspect of that‚ what is to be enjoyed‚ that part which is to be enjoyed. And once you know how to do it‚ then you say‚ ""We are swimming in the Ocean of Joy."" The ocean is the same. But now you just achieve those beautiful drops of ambrosia‚ which are in that ocean and the rest are worried of getting drowned – same ocean‚ same world. That's why they say it's a maya‚ but after this discretion is shining there's no maya.",https://www.amruta.org/p/2555,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11470,Collectivity,,,Collectivity is the blessing of Shri Krishna. He teaches you to be collective‚ the fun of collectivity‚ the enjoyment of collectivity. A person who is secluded‚ who keeps himself off like a drunkard is not the one who worships Shri Krishna. The one who is one with Shri Krishna enjoys everyone‚ especially if they are all realized souls. That person enjoys their company very much.,https://www.amruta.org/p/2340,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11480,Collectivity,,To be collective is to be joyous,"Anybody who cannot be collective is not yet a Sahaja Yogi – not yet a Sahaja Yogi at all. Collective in the sense that anybody who cannot live with other Sahaja Yogis‚ who tries to find faults with someone all the time‚ wants to run away with his wife and will stay somewhere else or with her husband‚ who wants to get out‚ is not a person who's collective  ....
Anybody who goes against collectivity‚ who sticks to their bhoots‚ sticks to their negativity will have to get out of Sahaja Yoga and that is to be remembered‚ that to be collective is to be joyous‚ is to be progressive‚ to be going further.",https://www.amruta.org/p/4424,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11490,Doctor of Doctors,,Shri Krishna is also a Dhanvantari. That means the doctor of doctors. He is the One who cures,This Yogeshwara‚ Shri Krishna is also a Dhanvantari. That means the doctor of doctors. He is the one who cures because it's all the brain and the vibrations which flow on the nervous system. So He cures people through His brain  .... Supposing somebody is having a problem‚ say on his heart. So as soon as he puts his hands to My photograph‚ immediately he gets problem on his left finger here. The brain is working. So in your brain‚ My vibrations go to Shri Krishna and they start sending these messages because I am also Shri Krishna. So this computer acts and immediately you know what's wrong with that person. He is a heart patient. You don't have to do any diagnosis. You don't have to do anything. Immediately you know. And who does this? It is the principle of Shri Krishna in the brain of the Virata. See this is also working for some people‚ I think. Now you are convinced about it. You know that it works‚ it acts like this‚ it happens like that and how it communicates through you. So this computer of Mine communicates. Now‚ in a computer if you go‚ you can just press the button. Of course‚ they are all man-made‚ but whatever it is‚ you then get the result. Here it is not like that. It is the brain which automatically gives the result‚ immediately through the other person. And also the same brain tells you what is to be done to such-and-such a person‚ how to work it out. The same brain is emitting vibrations and those vibrations are flowing through this brain and they are the ones who tell you what's wrong with this person. So all this work of penetration is done by Shri Krishna‚ no doubt. He takes these vibrations‚ puts them into another brain and then that brain‚ that central nervous system starts working and then you get the result. But instantaneously‚ it's not so much time it takes. Another way I have described it‚ it just works immediately. As soon as they put their hands before Me‚ immediately.,https://www.amruta.org/p/1831,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11500,The Vishuddhi Chakra,,,These hands are to be used for collectivity. See‚ you say namaste when we meet others. To thousands of people we can say namaste. But I don't like the shaking hands business because it's no good. Shaking hands doesn't create any collectivity. On the contrary‚ you might get all kinds of pins and needles and all kinds of problems from others. But‚ when you talk to people‚ also‚ with these hands only you can feel them. With these hands only you can care for your children. With these hands only you can suggest your softness‚ your sweetness  .... Your gestures and everything should show very heartfelt emotions and then only these gestures have some meaning  .... I would say that the most important things are the hands which act for your collectivity. As far as you are concerned there are many other angels and other ganas who are standing behind you. They also extend their help   ... help to you whenever you want to communicate something. They also do your jobs very well‚ so whatever is expressed in your hand or through your hand‚ they immediately pick up.,https://www.amruta.org/p/2311,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11510,The Vishuddhi Chakra,,,In your art‚ in your music‚ in your gestures‚ in every way‚ your hands are very important. But the Vishuddhi chakra also plays a part‚ as you know‚ on the 16 chakras or the sub-plexuses which look after our face‚ our ears‚ nose‚ eyes‚ neck‚ all these things are looked after by Vishuddhi chakra. As a result‚ you can become great actors. You can have eyes which are innocent. You can have skin which is shining. You can have ears which can hear the divine music and you can have a nose which shows your dignity.,https://www.amruta.org/p/7023,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11520,The Vishuddhi Chakra,,The Nose: is the specialty of Shri Krishna,The nose is very important. Nose has to be pure in the sense that you should be able to discard whatever is smelling badly and you should be able to accept whatever is fragrant. It's very important because nose is the specialty of Shri Krishna‚ I would say‚ in the sense that He's the Kubera‚ and the Kubera has given the nose to the Goddess. Some people have a bad habit of moving their nose just to show disapproval or something like this. They go on doing like that. This is very wrong because then you are insulting yourselves; you're insulting your Kubera power. So you have to keep your nose in a dignified manner.,https://www.amruta.org/p/2311,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11530,The Vishuddhi Chakra,,All the qualities of your Vishuddhi depend upon the teeth,Then your teeth are very important. You have thirty-two teeth‚ see; 16 of Krishna's powers divided into‚ you can say‚ thirty-two. These are your teeth on both the sides. The Right side is on top and the left down below. That is one thing we neglect very much in the West‚ I must say. In India it is not. It is very much we neglect and that's what we have to look after   ... I've seen many people who come to Me in the evening in the program‚ such a horrible smell from their mouth comes out. It is not that it's a disease‚ but they have not cleansed their teeth   ... Teeth are very important and one must look after them. On the teeth depends all the qualities of your Vishuddhi.,https://www.amruta.org/p/2311,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11540,The Vishuddhi Chakra,,The features are given by Shri Krishna but the inner part of it is all done by Shri Rama,In our Sahaja Yoga we have three Hearts: one is the left‚ another is the right‚ and one is the center. Now the right Heart is a very important thing. The right Heart looks after the whole lungs‚ both the lungs‚ all the throat‚ the trachea; the nose‚ the inner part. The outer side is looked after‚ we can say‚ the features are given by Shri Krishna‚ but the inner part of it is all done by Shri Rama. They are the same‚ but one acts as an inner part‚ another as the outer part. It gives you the ears‚ from the inner part‚ Shri Rama does. He gives you the eyes‚ in the inner part of the eyes. Now‚ it's so important to have the inner side all right and the outer side. It is an example of Shri Rama that He never cared for the outer side or the outward looks of a person. Because He came before Shri Krishna‚ He tried to build up the inner side of a human being. So we can say‚ though He is on the right Heart‚ He acts through your Hamsa chakra and partly through your Vishuddhi chakra in the inner side of it. Because Shri Krishna‚ in the inner side of it is Shri Rama‚ is Shri Vishnu.,https://www.amruta.org/p/3870,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11550,The Vishuddhi Chakra,,The Eyes: give you the play and the power of Shri Krishna,It's very important that eyes are the ones which give you the play of Shri Krishna‚ the power of Shri Krishna. Even a glance‚ a little glance of a person who has Krishna conscious- ness‚ as they call it‚ if he has Krishna consciousness‚ should be able to awaken the Kundalini‚ should be able to redeem‚ should be able to comfort‚ should be able to cure anyone.,https://www.amruta.org/p/7229,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11560,The Vishuddhi Chakra,,All the qualities of Shri Krishna can be expressed on your face,A person who is spiritually endowed has an expression which can never be aggres- sive. He may not be good looking‚ may not be very   ... a sort of a attractive personality‚ but the expression on the face is absolutely saintly. That is also the blessings of Shri Krishna   ... The whole thing becomes absolutely mild‚ soft‚ peaceful and very joyous. All the quali- ties of Shri Krishna can be expressed on your face. You can be sometimes mischievous to look at. So many expressions there are which come on the face and give you a very sweet feeling. But some people have a habit of looking in the mirror all the time‚ which is very wrong‚ because it gives you a kind of a funny ego. Is better to look at Shri Krishna's photograph than to look at your own faces‚ so that your face will become like that of Shri Krishna   ... So‚ one has to be careful not to pay so much attention and importance to your own self‚ but to your Self which is within‚ which is your spirit‚ and if you look after that side‚ then all these things will happen in such a beautiful manner. Also‚ the hair are looked after by Shri Krishna. Now‚ you see‚ you know that He's very fond of anything that is‚ um‚ like butter‚ so you have to put either butter‚ or oil‚ or something in your hair. If you don't put it you will become bald. I mean it is after all a karma palla.,https://www.amruta.org/p/2311,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11570,Cleansing Techniques,,Right Vishuddhi,"Shri Krishna's essence is sweetness – madhuriya‚ madhuriya and His power was Radha. ""Ra"" is energy ""dha"" – means the one who has sustained the energy. And Her power was‚ She was called as alahada. ""Alahada"" means joy giving qualities – She had. So Shri Krishna's qualities were that He was Yogeshwara‚ so He was the witness and sweetness. Now a person who shouts and screams and talks loudly and loses his temper in a very loud voice‚ or who speaks very loudly all the time‚ they all suffer from the right Vishuddhi [catch]. So one should understand that even when you have to scold somebody you have to just say in a sweet manner ""What are you doing? Why are you doing like this?"" Otherwise if you say ""Why did you do like this?""– finished! The right Vishuddhi is over‚ it's finished now.
So for the right Vishuddhi we use the mantra of Vithala and Rukmini  .... If you are talking loudly‚ if you talk too much‚ if you intimidate people with your talking then you catch on right Vishuddhi. So for that the best is to take some rest and give some rest to your right Vishuddhi by stopping your talk. Go into mauna they say‚ just don't talk. For some time if you don't talk you will see that your Vishuddhi will be improved‚ your
problems will be improved.",https://www.amruta.org/p/7054,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,Right Vishuddhi,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Advice,,,

11600,Cleansing Techniques,,"And say ""Allah-Hu-Akbar"" 16 times","Now another thing you have to do is to put your fingers into your ears and say ""Allah-Hu-Akbar"" 16 times. Put your head back. It will clear out most of your problems about Vishuddhi. Mantras are to give strength to your Deities. Of course‚ Deities are very powerful‚ but strength‚ meaning the vehicle‚ which is carrying the Deity‚ becomes stronger. As you know‚ the mantra of ""Radha-Krishna"" or ""Vithala"" is the same for right Vishuddhi; but ""Allah-hu-Akbar"" has two things in it: first is‚ of course‚ the Vishuddhi and also the collectivity. So by the first one‚ you get bad colds and you get your attention diverted and other problems of the ear‚ nose‚ throat. And by the second one when it is spoiled‚ you say aggressive words‚ sarcastic language - all kinds of things that breaks the collectivity. So either you suffer from a bad cold‚ so you cannot speak‚ and when you speak you hurt others   ...
Another thing one should try is a physical treatment of your throat‚ it is very simple‚ I've seen is that‚ you push back your tongue‚ and put‚ this is a physical thing‚ put your chin here and try to push back your tongue as much as possible. Now hold your breath‚ push back your tongue as much as you can. Kundalini will move further. First you have done Allah-Hu-Akbar‚ so you have bent backwards.

It's a very-very dangerous thing to go on looking at something continuously with concentration.,https://www.amruta.org/p/4424,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Advice,,,
11750,Cleansing Techniques,,The Guru and Krishna Principle,In collectivity Krishna principle‚ plus the principle of the Guru is mixed. When he becomes the Guru‚ then the collectivity starts. When these two get integrated‚ then the collectivity starts and as a result of that‚ you get discretion. So to improve the discretion part‚ is a very simple thing we do is to take vibrated ghee or butter‚ which is heated up‚ and put it in the nose. But before that‚ we gargle our throat with the salt‚ which represents the Guru Principle. You can also take a little ghee or butter on top of a hot water cup and if you drink it that soothes all your sides because that is‚ Krishna is soothed by that.,https://www.amruta.org/p/387,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Advice,,,
11760,Cleansing Techniques,,You are deceiving yourself,"The main thing that I'm trying to tell you‚ that you can maneuver your Vishuddhi. The way you want to put your expression‚ the way you want to make your face‚ the way you want to suggest something. You can maneuver and you can keep your heart away from it. In the heart you may have poison for a person‚ but outwardly you may say to that person in a very sweet manner something that a person might feel impressed. But in this all this behavior‚ pattern of behavior‚ you are deceiving yourself‚ not deceiving the another person. Because your self is Spirit‚ which knows you very well. And this will go on and on for all your lives that have to come. So there is no need in any way to be artificial in your expression‚ there is no need to hide anything in your expression. Of course‚ I mean‚ if you don't like someone you need not just say‚ ""I don't like you‚"" but in that case you have to be not also so much appreciative of the person‚ that he's deluded into your appreciation.",https://www.amruta.org/p/4424,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Advice,,,
11770,Lalita Chakra,,,So many things can be said about Vishuddhi chakra‚ but specially I am more concerned about two chakras on two sides. One of them is‚ as you know‚ is the Lalita chakra Left side and Shri chakra on the Right side. I've always told ladies that please keep this covered. Its looks so simple‚ but it's very important. Don't expose this because the power of this should be preserved. Shri chakra and Lalita chakra‚ they are very important. They are I should say feminine powers and they are the feminine powers of Shri Krishna‚ which must be understood that whatever way you respect your body that is the way your chakras are and that is the way you suffer.,https://www.amruta.org/p/2340,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11780,Related organs,,Eyes,Apart from that‚ the eyes are supplied by this chakra only. So when you look at something it should be a very pure glance. The purer it is the better you will enjoy‚ but if the glance is not pure‚ is shifty‚ going from here to there‚ there to there‚ then you are actually going against your dharma‚ against your evolutionary process‚ and one day will come when you might become blind‚ you might develop cataracts‚ you might develop all kinds of diseases of the eyes‚ which are very important to pay attention to.,https://www.amruta.org/p/2340,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11790,Related organs,,Teeth,Then your teeth are very important   ...The reason for neglect is that‚ I would say‚ is laziness – must be the laziness‚ but at least twice or thrice you must brush your teeth. It is important‚ so I need not say‚ but more important is to change the brush. Also‚ you have to use butter‚ or salt and oil to rub your gums. If you rub your gums properly you will never have problems with your teeth and your gums. Moreover‚ every time in the evening‚ you must again brush your teeth   ... I've seen many people who come to Me in the evening in the program‚ such a horrible smell from their mouth comes out. It is not that it's a disease‚ but it is – only thing is that they have not cleansed their teeth. Also‚ there are people who will not even brush their teeth and start eating breakfast. I don't know‚ it was another theory started‚ I think‚ that you can eat your food without brushing.,https://www.amruta.org/p/2311,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11800,Related organs,,Tongue,Then this connection also goes to the tongue. The tongue is looked after. Those people have a very bad habit of suddenly saying horrible things‚ of suddenly saying very bad words‚ or sometimes getting after somebody with the very bad remarks‚ all such things are very bad for the tongue. This is what Shri Krishna doesn't like. In case you use your tongue for saying harsh things to others‚ being sarcastic‚ being harsh on others‚ or using abusive words‚ thus your tongue one day I don't know how it will react. It will react in different ways. God knows it might become thick‚ it won't move‚ God knows it may be sucked inside. That's the physical side of it‚ but also mental side of it that you won't know what you are talking about. If you have to say something‚ you'll say something else‚ it's possible‚ with your tongue. It's quite possible that we may not able to talk‚ may not be able to say anything. Anything is possible if you try to trouble your tongue like that‚ using it for wrong purposes. Tongue is not for‚ being used for abusive things‚ as well as for some people try to be extra kind and gentle and this and that‚ to achieve some ends. This kind of thing also is very‚ very much dangerous for the tongue‚ and you might develop blisters on your tongues‚ to such an extent that people who even go on saying harsh things to others and all that‚ can develop a kind of a cancer.,https://www.amruta.org/p/2340,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11810,Related organs,,Throat,The throat is very important. We should look after it. Those people who shout‚ scream‚ ultimately can loose their power of speech‚ can become frantic with their prob- lems of the throat. Specially throat can develop horrible diseases‚ by which your neck can get swollen up‚ we call it snake disease and you feel suffocated. So when you talk to someone‚ talk clearly in a sweet manner‚ but don't shout at a person‚ never. Neither you try to show peevishness in your speech. If you are peevish then cancer can set in. So both ways you have to be careful as you are Sahaja Yogis. You have to have this knowledge that you will not do‚ bear anything nonsensical if somebody speaks‚ means you should not accept it. One may say something to you‚ it's all right. And sometimes you should tell him off‚ that you were saying like this it's not so. It's best is not to bear it up and to suffer. You are not Christ‚ you don't have His powers. Because if you do that you'll develop cancer. So try to be in a way just in the center‚ watching everything. If there's aggression or if there's recession‚ one of the two things. You must not give in to any of these attitudes‚ but develop an attitude of standing very firmly on your own grounds.,https://www.amruta.org/p/2340,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11820,Related organs,,Throat,You people do not clear your throats‚ and your tongues which is another thing very much against the Vishuddhi and that must be one of the reasons why your Vishuddhis are bad. Though it is not fashionable here in the West‚ but a very important thing is to put your two fingers in the mouth and rub your tongue in such a way that everything comes out in the morning. This is very important because that accumulates and then it rots. So this has to be done‚ and maybe you might think that this is where you make a noise and all that‚ it does not matter. You have to clear out your throat and that's how you will keep your Vishuddhis very clear. This is one of the things‚ and another thing is that you must always use water as much as possible for washing when you go for your morning ablutions. Water must be used. Paper is a very dirty and unhygienic habit‚ but even if you use paper‚ you must use water afterwards. It's very important that all the time the water must be used as much as possible. For Sahaja Yogis it is a very‚ very important thing.,https://www.amruta.org/p/715,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11830,Enemies of the Vishuddhi Chakra,,,"But one has to realize that the message of Shri Krishna was to surrender. Now the sur- rendering that we think in the gross way is like an enemy surrenders to another enemy. So when the word ""Surrender"" is spoken‚ we build up our barriers by thinking that we have to surrender something to the other part. But when Shri Krishna was talking about surrender‚ He was saying that – ""Surrender your enemies to me so that I will get rid of them.",https://www.amruta.org/p/4697,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11840,Enemies of the Vishuddhi Chakra,,Ego,"Now the worst enemy that we have is our ego. And with ego starts all kinds of other problems‚ because it is the biggest barrier for our growth. And the ego starts as you know from the Vishuddhi chakra‚ and can be sucked into Vishuddhi chakra   ... So the strength of a person comes through the Vishuddhi chakra in his speech. But it can be absolutely stiff also‚ the strength could be absolutely stiff. Supposing you have a very strong weapon but you can't lift it‚ so what is the use of having a weapon like that? See‚ this Mr. Ego tries to make the weapon heavy and stiff like jammed machine-guns. Now that is what He has said that – ""Surrender your ego to Me‚"" so that when you say a mantra or utter words‚ they are effective as weapons‚ good weapons‚ effective good weapons‚ efficient.",https://www.amruta.org/p/4697,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11850,Enemies of the Vishuddhi Chakra,,Left Vishuddhi comes from ego,"But when the ego is so strong in a country like America‚ when we do wrong‚ we do not want to accept that it was wrong‚ it was against our ascent‚ it was against our higher goals   ... So because you're indiscreet‚ you do wrong things. When you make mistakes‚ instead of developing the discretion about it that this was a mistake‚ next time we should not do it‚ facing up to it‚ what we do is to feel guilty about it‚ so you escape it‚ spoiling the other chakra also. That is how people get a problem on the left Vishuddhi‚ and left Vishuddhi is that you feel guilty. It's very good to feel guilty than to do anything about it. That's the best way to escape it. Actually we have seen that mostly left Vishuddhi comes from ego. When ego is too much‚ you can't bear your ego‚ so you put it in the guilty side of it‚ and you say‚ ""I'm very guilty‚ I should not have done it.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/7229,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And when talking to others‚ try to develop sweet methods‚ sweet ways of not hurting other people. And you will be surprised that Vishuddhi will immediately start behaving in such a sweet manner‚ because the bhoots don't like sweetness‚ they are quarrelsome. They are harsh‚ they are always trying to say something to hurt   ... So this Vishuddhi on the right hand side is to be controlled by surrendering as it is said   ...
Actually you surrender your ego to begin with. And this ego when you surrender‚ it has to be done from you heart‚ it should not be a lip service. From your heart: ""I don't want this ego any more. I want Reality. Let the Reality be seen by me‚ felt by me‚ enjoyed by me."" And once you start doing it from your heart‚ you will be amazed that your voice will become sweet. Apart from that‚ it will have the Divine Power flowing through it. That is what we say that you have now wak shakti‚ which means the power of speech.
So when you surrender ego‚ what you do actually is to say that ""I'm not doing anything‚ it is You who does everything."" So that a little drop has now become an ocean.

11870,Intelligence,,The greatest enemy of a human being is his intelligence,So the violence is now entering into our films‚ Indian films also‚ but now they have taken some objection. Maybe it is too much for us. But this kind of thing that you can kill anybody‚ so if you go on like this‚ you see if that is the criteria of greatness then Rwanda people should be placed highest in the evolutionary process. Killing somebody is not allowed. Thou shalt not kill. Muslims are killing. Everybody's killing everyone. The other day they killed a very nice man in India for nothing at all. This idea of aggressiveness ultimately takes you to the killing part. You can't even create one ant. How can you kill human beings like that? Of course‚ this killing business is taken to the highest limit‚ like Hitler believed that he was top of the world. This is same‚ that you just forget what you are and you start assuming through your ego that you are something very great. Also‚ in Sahaja Yoga I find recently there are some people who are saying they're gods‚ they're deities‚ everything. So this ego business is actually taking energy of your intelligence‚ and the greatest enemy of a human being is‚ is his intelligence‚ I think‚ because it's so limited‚ it is so conditioned‚ and it is so arrogant‚ and it is so blind.,https://www.amruta.org/p/1831,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11880,Pride / Vanity,,We should be proud of one thing only‚ that His vibrations flow through us,Now the second thing you have to surrender‚ is the pride‚ or vanity   ... Before God‚ what is your property? What is your money? What is your position? What is your family? What is your education? You see‚ everything has no value in the presence of God. The possessions that one values so much have no value. So one has to realize that if we are the possessions of God‚ we should be proud of one thing only‚ that His vibrations flow through us. That is: He is proud of us   ... So the pride and the vanity of artificiality‚ artificial things‚ is all man-made‚ mythical‚ and should be surrendered because it is a myth.,https://www.amruta.org/p/11524,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11890,Greed,,Nothing is mine‚ that is the Truth,"Another enemy we have is greed. I mean material greed and also human greed‚ like possessing your wife‚ possessing your children‚ possessing this‚ possessing Mataji also. This also must be surrendered. And this could be very dangerous in Sahaja Yoga also. This is my carpet‚ this is my camera‚ this is my tape-recorder. Once you start understanding what is mine is not the Truth‚ nothing is mine‚ that's the Truth. Also some people I know of‚ they say that ""My job‚ or my business‚ or my enterprise.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/4697,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11900,Lust,,Giving too much importance to the agencies of lust,Also the lust of other women and indulging into lust too much. Giving too much importance to the agencies of lust. That creates great problems‚ not only for Sahaja- Yogis‚ but on the whole for Sahaja Yoga also. It is expressed in both types of people; those who are living in a very free world‚ as well as people who are very suppressed. I know of people‚ those who are supposed to be brought up in very religious 'so called' atmosphere‚ when exposed to women‚ suddenly get too much attracted towards them.,https://www.amruta.org/p/4697,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11910,Jealousy,,Nothing is mine‚ that is the Truth,See‚ it is that maturity of your innocence that must be developed‚ that keeps you a very religious person‚ dharmic person. And the innocence to know how far to go with men and women. That's the wisdom of innocence   ... So the innocence is not stupidity. It is a complete wisdom‚ and very mature in its full form. It just knows how to be with people without indulging into anyone of these enemies. Each enemy is sufficient to finish not only one person‚ but billions and billions. So best way to develop that absolute nature of your Vishuddhi chakra is to witness the whole thing with a detached mind. And to develop love for your Mother in your heart‚ so that She cleanses all these enemies‚ in such a way that when you are faced with them‚ you are a powerful person.,https://www.amruta.org/p/4697,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Innocence,,
11920,Jealousy,,,"Then the human mind has another capacity to be jealous‚ to be jealous of others. This also comes from unwise understanding   ... The stupid jealousies that you have are as you know‚ of no value‚ neither in this world‚ nor in that world. The most surprising thing is that the Sahaja Yogis feel jealous of each other!
And I still can't understand how can it be? If you are standing in the sunshine‚ then you all are jealous of your shadows! Somebody's shadows are big‚ somebody's shadows are small‚ so you are jealous of each other? Sometimes I give a present to one person‚ can't give to others‚ then they get jealous! If I give more time to some- body‚ then others are jealous! I only give more time sometimes to people who really are getting lost!   ...
A Sahaja Yogi must have discretion if his Vishuddhi is all right. You should understand that what I'm saying is to be used discreetly‚ not blindly. So you can understand‚ without discretion‚ whatever I say‚ how funnily you can use it so detrimental to your growth.",https://www.amruta.org/p/11524,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11930,Hot Temper,,"Another offshoot of ego is ""hot temper""",So another offshoot of ego is called as hot temper. Of course it is said to be used against people who try to insult your Mother‚ you have to do that. That must be used for people who go against the Holy Ghost as Christ has said. In the same way you should not tolerate any non-sense against Me from anyone whatsoever‚ not even this much. But you can tolerate other Sahaja Yogis in other matters.,https://www.amruta.org/p/11524,Shri Krishna Puja,,,,,,,,,,,,,Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11940,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11950,,,," ""First we should know who is Vishnumaya. It's very important to know because in the Devi Mahatmyam She is only described as the Incarnation of the Goddess: ""Vishnumaya iti shabdita"" [chant 5]‚ She is called as Vishnumaya.
But let's see who is She? After all‚ this Vishnumaya is who? So Vishnumaya is the Kali‚ we can say‚ and is the daughter of Mahakali. She came on this earth and killed many‚ many devils and many rakshasas to save the saints from their aggression and She always acts in that manner to kill all the negativity of the world. She is very quick at it‚ I should say‚ and She knows where is the negativity and She tries to burn that negativity as fast as possible.
Now the origin is like this that this Vishnumaya was the daughter of Mahakali who was created by Mahakali Herself to fight these demons‚ but also She was given special weapons to do this work. But at the time of Shri Krishna She was born as the sister of Shri Krishna‚ and instead of Shri Krishna being killed by Her uncle‚ as you know the story is‚ She was exchanged‚ She was actually the daughter of Yeshoda‚ exchanged for Shri Krishna. And this girl‚ little girl was killed by the uncle of Shri Krishna‚ who became the lightning in the sky and announced that ""Shri Krishna has already incarnated‚ and your destiny is in His hands and He is going to kill you‚"" She told Kamsa. So this is the Vishnumaya.
Then again She took Her birth at the time of Shri Krishna when He was the King of Dwarika‚ and She married‚ I should say‚ these five Pandavas. Because She was Draupadi. There's a significance in that‚ that this is the one who joins five elements. And these five Pandavas represented that five elements and so She joined them as one wife because She's the one who joins all the five elements that have created this material universe. Thus‚ we have a relationship established with Shri Krishna‚ and Shri Krishna as you know that‚ treated Her as a sister.
Now once when you know that they tried to insult Draupadi by pulling out Her saris‚ it was Shri Krishna who helped Her because She was His sister and such a powerful lady. She's also responsible for the Mahabharata. She's the one who brought forth‚ She's the one who told that: ""You have to fight these Pandavas."" She absolutely told them very clearly that: ""You have to fight the Kauravas and in such a way that they should be defeated not only but they should be destroyed.""
Because the chastity of woman is very important and in India anybody who tries to molest the chastity of woman is to be cursed‚ is to be destroyed. And this was a very great message of Mahabharata that only because She was insulted so much‚ all the war took place and all of them were destroyed""",https://www.amruta.org/p/4024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Shri Krishna,,Shri Vishnumaya,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Chastity,,
11960,,,," ""So is the Krishna's Sister who is a much more dynamic and   ...much more fiery personality – much‚ much more fiery personality. Shri Krishna's essence is that He is sweetness. Madhuria is His capacity and Radha is the Allahda Dayini Shakti‚ means the One which gives you that joy which creates   ...‚ raises your hair with joy – so‚ but in Sanskrit it is pulakit‚ pulakita is the word.
So this beauty of Shri Krishna which is sweetness‚ the leela‚ creating beautiful feelings of oneness of communication – all that is in Shri Krishna. But She's the One Who warns‚ and that is how the warning came. And She's a very fiery personality which warns everyone.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/6080,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Shri Krishna,Shri Radha,Shri Vishnumaya,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11970,,,,"""The subtler part of this Vishnumaya is that She knows the truth. When She shines you can see everything out of Her. Even for a short time‚ She exposes in the darkness everything. In the same way‚ when Vishnumaya starts acting on you‚ then She exposes the truth to you.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/3829,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Shri Vishnumaya,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11980,,,,"""The Canada as such I feel is the Hamsa Chakra of the Vishuddhi‚ but the power of Saraswati becomes Mahasaraswati when it is manifested by the Mahabrahmadeva which is called as Hiranyagarbha.
For that She has to cross through the Hamsa. She crosses through Hamsa and becomes the Vishnumaya Shakti. I mean She is the Vishnumaya Shakti. So Saraswati becomes the Vishnumaya. She crosses at two points – one at Hamsa and another at Vishuddhi – so She is the Sister of Shri Krishna.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/6080,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Shri Vishnumaya,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11990,,,," ""So the money is another side of Saraswati. Saraswati is different from Lakshmi‚ so the Lakshmi and the Saraswati never go hand in hand. This is the reason why when they get after Lakshmi‚ run after money too much‚ they get shocks. Because there's a – suddenly you find stock exchange has fallen‚ there's a recession‚ this business is gone‚ somebody who's very rich suddenly becomes a poor man. Is all the work‚ this is all the work of the Saraswati. And if somebody is too much in Saraswati – reads too many books‚ is an artist who is very ambitious‚ who tries to outshine other artist and all that – such a person also gets back a reward from Lakshmi that his things never sell‚ he never gets money‚ he starves‚ all sorts of thing.
So these two things are in balance only in Hamsa‚ or we can say they are in balance when you are Sahaja Yogi. So this has to be achieved and is to be put together in balance that you have the blessings of the Saraswati as well as that of Lakshmi. But it crosses only at the Hamsa point and at the Vishuddhi point. So what do we have to do to bring the balance is that whatever we are earning‚ whatever we are doing‚ we should not be in mediocre way. We should try to do it in a dynamic way‚ in a fiery way. These two things should be combined at the Vishuddhi level. So now‚ supposing you are going to give a lecture about Sahaja Yoga in a fiery way‚ and if you wear a dress that you look like a hippie or somebody coming out of a jail‚ nobody is going to take you seriously. But if you're properly dressed and you look respectable and presentation is good‚ and then you give fiery speech‚ everybody is going to listen.

What happens in the gross happens in the subtle. So‚ one has to take an incarnation. So the Guru principle has to take an incarnation; to come down to this earth.

As a result of that‚ clouds are created.
This electricity is not created in the ocean – that would create problems. Is created in the sky so that everybody can see it‚ can hear it. They see it first and hear it later. It's all well organised‚ well calculated – that is Vishnumaya.
But it was created‚ also‚ with some understanding by human beings on this Earth. First of all they saw the two clouds rubbing each other. So in the primitive stage‚ human beings tried to rub two material things to create electricity. So two material things‚ that is two parts of matter‚ when rubbed created the electricity.  It's very significant to see: matter can be used to create electricity! The spark of the electricity comes from the matter. Without matter‚ they could not have started cooking the food.

First of all‚ it helps us to pass the messages from your heart to your head. It is the one by which we integrate. Our heart and head is integrated by the Vishnumaya principle more than the Vishuddhi on the Right side.
Vishuddhi on the Right side can create collectivity‚ can create understanding with each other but on the Left side‚ [it] helps you to keep a complete integration between your heart and your head.
If there is a guilt‚ you just think of it and analyse it‚ it means that there's a struggle between you in your heart and your mind‚ isn't it? Simple as that. If it was integrated you would not feel guilty. And that is why all these artificial theories that have come‚ all these artificial yarns that you have read and all that‚ you forget it. You are a Sahaja Yogi and you have entered into the Kingdom of God – enjoy! That's all you have to do.

I mean all the time it has been there‚ since I have been in the West. Can you imagine? It has never vanished. So this chakra is all the time working‚ poor thing is so much now tired‚ Vishnumaya's chakra.
So what happens‚ really‚ we should see the physical side of it. It's very important to understand it. You see‚ from childhood‚ if we are taught in a society like this‚ where you are an extrovert‚ you have to achieve something‚ some success or this and that‚ then the idea of strength is given to you‚ that it is weakness to tolerate something.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/1458,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Shri Vishnumaya,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Catch,

Why? Why should you sulk for that? Because there's another place where this ego can go‚ is when you come round‚ you see here it crosses at Vishuddhi‚ so when it is suppressed from the other side it goes into that Vishuddhi part. So then you get the Left Vishuddhi. It is nothing but pure ego‚ believe me‚ it's pure ego. Because it has no other way to get in‚ it goes there. And that's how you sulk and think. Think so you get more ego. You fill up your Left side and you sulk. You never face [it].
Now. The practical way‚ the central path‚ is established by being in reality. Now as a matter of habit you must develop. Supposing something has gone wrong‚ tell yourself‚ ""Yes it has gone wrong‚ because I have done the mistake. Alright‚ why did I do the mistake? Because of this. So next time no."" But it's very easy to avoid everything‚ come to this and enjoy your ego feeling sad. It's an indulgence. And others also feel‚ ""Oh‚ he's felt 'I'm sorry I've killed you!'‚"" you see. He feels sorry for it.
Yes! I have seen! It is gone so far in the minds of the Western people that there are laws which really forgive people who should never be forgiven. They also try to forgive people.

Fourth one is the most important for all of us is to know that there is a nadi which passes through left Visuddhi into the heart. Starts from the heart‚ goes up‚ passes through Agnya. It has four petals‚ opens up.",https://www.amruta.org/p/638,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Buddha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You have seen yesterday what happened with Me. It just works. You become [the] master of these three gunas. Like I used to describe that: first you are sitting in the car and somebody""s driving you. He uses your left and Right side‚ or you can say‚ the brake and accelerator‚ and the car is driven. Then he starts teaching you how to drive. Then you start learning by using your left and right - accelerator and your brake. Then the third stage comes in where you become a driver but still you are worried about the master who is sitting behind‚ that still you are doing a mistake‚ you are doing wrong. But then the fourth stage comes‚ you'll become the master‚ you make others drive. [You] order here‚ anyone‚ order the Sun‚ order the Moon‚ order. Order means just tell them‚ I mean not question of any domination is there. Just desire it‚ just say it‚ it works out.

12740,,,," We can say the brain of a molecule or an atom is like the nucleus‚ body of the nucleus. But the one that controls the nucleus is the Spirit that resides within the nucleus. So now you have got the attention‚ or the body – the whole body of the atom– then the nucleus‚ and inside the nucleus is the Spirit. In the same way – we have this body‚ the attention of the body. And then we have the  ... we have the nucleus – is the brain. And the Spirit is in the heart. So‚ the brain is controlled through the Spirit. How? That around the heart there are seven auras which can be multiplied into any number‚ seven raised to power sixteen hundred‚ which are the ones which watch the seven chakras‚ raised to power sixteen thousand. Now this Spirit is watching through this aura; watching – I am again saying ""watching""- through this aura. This aura is watching the behavior of your seven centers in your brain. Is also watching all the nerves that are working in the brain – ""watching""‚ again. But when you bring the Spirit into your brain‚ then you go two steps ahead‚ because when your Kundalini rises‚ She touches the Sadashiva and Sadashiva informs the Spirit. Informs in the sense – reflects in the Spirit. So that's the first state where the watching auras start communicating through your different chakras in the brain and integrating it.
But when you bring your Spirit to your brain – this is the second state – then you really become self-realized‚ in the full way‚ in the full way because then your Self‚ that is the Spirit‚ becomes your brain. Action is very dynamic‚ it opens then the fifth dimension in the human being. First‚ when you become realized‚ collectively conscious‚ and start raising the Kundalini‚ you are in‚ you cross the fourth dimension. But when your Spirit comes into your brain‚ then you become the fifth dimension – means‚ you become the doer. Our brain‚ now‚ for example‚ says‚ ""All right‚ lift this thing up"". So you touch it with your hand‚ you lift it up. You are the doer. But when the brain becomes the Spirit‚ the Spirit is the doer‚ and when Spirit is the doer‚ then you become a complete Shiva – self-realized.",https://www.amruta.org/p/1905,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And then‚ take this detached brain‚ completely filled with the color of the Spirit. It will automatically happen. As long as you'll have these limitations to your attention‚ it will not happen.

And if you can make a photograph of a carbon atom‚ and see it from right to the left‚ you do see the Swastika. This is the fact‚ is established and if you see from the left to the right it is Omkara‚ so thus what I've said is verified‚ scientifically. But if you see from down below upward‚ then what do you see is the Alpha and Omega. Now Christ has said‚ ""I am the Alpha and I am the Omega.""

12780,,,Carbon atom,"Shri Ganesha has four arms.  I had mentioned that the Carbon Atom also has four valencies.  It also has four arms.  In nirakar‚ (subtle‚ formless state) when you look at Him from the Left side‚ you see Him in the form of a Swastika. I had told them to photograph a carbon atom‚ and to take the photo from four angles. The Left side showed the Swastika. When we look at it from the Right side‚ He shows up as Omkara — many omkaras – as many omkaras as there are carbon atoms‚ will be seen.  If you look at it from the underside towards the top‚ then the Greek letters Alpha and Omega‚ threaded into one integrated form which are used as symbols‚ become visible.  Jesus Christ had said‚ ""I am the Alpha‚ and I am the Omega"".  Alpha means the beginning‚ and Omega means the end.  How is it that these two symbols mentioned by Christ‚ can clearly be seen in the carbon atom!

When I said this‚ scientists in foreign countries immediately started researching‚ and found out that this was a fact.  They saw that when they took photos of the carbon atom from three different angles‚ they got exactly these three forms. From this it is clear that Jesus Christ became the Alpha and the Omega‚ and Shri Ganesha the Swastika and the Omkara.  So‚ it has been conclusively proved that Jesus Christ and Shri Ganesha are the same.",https://www.amruta.org/p/7232,,,,,,,,,,,Ganesha,,,,,,Christ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When It was used by Hitler in the beginning‚ it was the right type and he was successful. But then what happened‚ they had stencils and they started using it from the other side. So it was from the Left side it started‚ the other way round and then they were all destroyed. How powerful is Shri Ganesha's swastika you can see. Also we have proved now that swastika if you see from left to the right‚ is actually from the carbon atom. The carbon atom has got swastika and the whole of this chakra is made of carbon atoms‚ all put in series. Now if you look at it from the Left side – we have proved it now – if you look at it from the Left side to Right side‚ what you see is Omkar written. If you see it from Right side to Left side‚ you see the swastik‚ and if you see from down below upward then it looks like a cross. So‚ it proves that Shri Ganesha incarnated as Christ and He is the one who is worshipped all over the world. It's already written in the Devi Mahatmyam‚ if you read it‚ it's all clearly written about Him how He became an egg and out of the half of the egg became Christ and half of the egg was Shri Ganesh. All these things are there but we cannot understand it because we are confused. We don't want to see it in a proper sense‚ that this is already written there. So those who worship Christ also worship Shri Ganesh and whatever you say to Christ you are saying it to Shri Ganesha.

12810,,,,"Today we have such a great opportunity to celebrate the birth of Christ. He was born in a manger. All these things are already pre-planned. That He should in difficult situations show that whether you are born poor or rich‚ whether you are born in difficulties or in problems‚ if you have Divinity within you it shines by itself.
Today we are here to celebrate the birth of Omkara. It's a very big thing. I don't know if you can realise yet what it is. Which moves into everything whether it is‚ is the atom molecules into all the organising of chemicals also the plenary clause and the gravity. Into everything that moves is this Omkara. And your vibrations are nothing but Omkaras. Actually‚ My photograph‚ the vibrations‚ have come as Omkaras. On the head of the people there are Omkaras. How is this happening? These lights look like Omkaras. How is it on top of the heads of the Sahaja Yogis? There's all Sahaja Yogis' heads‚ there is Omkara‚ or Allah in Arabic language. My name also in Arabic.
Who is doing this? It is He who is doing all this. So Omkara itself takes the form to do things to convince you of Adi Shakti. He's the one who is handling all these powers. He doesn't enter into the photograph. No‚ He does not. But He plays a trick. After all you see‚ if you go into details‚ how do you get a photograph through the light? The light passes straight - a straight line‚ but if He wants He can make a light pass another way round. He can just transform the light. He can do whatever he likes‚ and that's what He does to convince you.
He (Christ) said that anything against Me I'll tolerate‚ but nothing against the Holy Ghost. This Holy Ghost is the Adi Shakti. Without Him you cannot go to the Sahasrara‚ so that in the whole play it's like the Suthudara. He's the one who is the conductor‚ the one who moves the strings in a puppet show. And so it is very important to pray to Shri Ganesh every time we have puja. We have to pray to Him and that's how we are praying to Lord Jesus Christ‚ every time. Without His auspiciousness‚ without His help‚ we cannot do Sahaja Yoga. He's the manager. You see I'm sitting here and He's the manager. Supposing there's no management‚ how will I speak here? Nothing can happen‚ but He is so efficient‚ and you never see Him working everything‚ doing everything.",https://www.amruta.org/p/6655,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12820,,,,So (it) is a very important day and that's how we have to learn that if you worship Ganapati or if you worship Christ‚ you should try to think what qualities we have got within ourselves.,https://www.amruta.org/p/6582,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12830,,,,"He has said that‚ 'Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.' Such a subtle thing. Even the eye should not have adultery‚ should not have lust and greed. Such a subtle thing He has said.
The first and foremost thing He has said is that you must enter into the Kingdom of God‚ that you must be born again.
Now one has to understand how Christ in His miraculous life has shown so many miracles. First of all His birth. It was immaculate.
I had told you long time back how we can prove that Christ was Ganesh‚ and He was the Logos‚ He was the‚ what we call‚ the Brahmanad‚ the first sound. By looking at your Left side from the Right side‚ if you see the Mooladhara‚ you will see swastikas‚ because it is made of carbon atom. If you see from the left to the right‚ you can see Omkara. And if you see from down upward‚ it looks like Alpha and Omega. In those days Christ said‚ 'I am the Alpha and I am the Omega.' And now we have made the animation‚ we have no arrangement to show you‚ I don't know if we could arrange it somehow. But you can see it clearly. What I have said can be proved.
So the first thing of Shri Ganesh is that wisdom‚ and that wisdom you see in the life of Christ‚ from the very beginning. He was so confident of it that at the age of twelve years He went and talked to these Pharisees‚ that means the people who were priests. We still have priests and mullahs and these bhutjees and all of them‚ these so-called 'darvamatandas' all over. But He went and argued with them‚ at that young age and He said‚ 'What are you doing here? What is this? What are you talking? All lip service.' He was discussing and talking to them‚ but His parents perhaps were frightened that these people might kill him‚ so they brought Him to India.
He came to India‚ for wisdom. I don't know where that wisdom is that's now missing from Indians. But it must be that this country was full of wisdom when He came and stayed in India and we have lots of memories about Him. Even the King Shalivahan met Him; it is described in his book that he met a man in Kashmir who was very saintly and he asked Him 'What's your name?' He said‚ 'My name is Issa.' See now‚ imagine‚ Issa (Eessa).'Ee' is the word used in Vedas for the Adi Shakti‚ 'sa' means with. He said‚ 'My name is Issa.' He (the king) said 'From what country do you come?' He (Lord Jesus) said‚ 'I come from a country which is foreign to Me and this is My country.'
Now recently I got a book which was hidden in a jar in Egypt until fifty years ago‚ they discovered it. And this book is called The Library of Hammadi‚ the place was called Hammadi where it was discovered. And what Christ said‚ what Thomas has written‚ when Thomas came to India he put all these things in‚ and it is very interesting. About drinking he said‚ 'Drinking begets debauchery.' It's a bad word to use. And Christians don't know.
And the basic thing of Christ's life is morality. He is on the Left side‚ as you can say he is from Shri Ganesh. And then He establishes himself at Agnya. But morality is the essence of His life. What we call in Indian language His character.
So another quality of Ganesh shown in Christ's life is a devotion to Mother. In that book Mary is telling them about knowledge‚ but this Paul objects to it. And She says that this is what you have to achieve. But he doesn't want to know. He is arguing with Her.
But then Thomas said what Christ said on the cross‚ 'Behold the Mother. She is the Mother of Christ and how dare you insult Her?' But just the opposite‚ Paul never respected women. So he called Her as just a woman‚ no respect. For Mahalakshmi‚ no respect! Can you imagine? Just a woman.",https://www.amruta.org/p/4220,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12840,,,,"In every incarnation in the evolution‚ every incarnation did something very‚ very unique. At the end of it Christ did the Resurrection part and He did it because He had to die.
Otherwise‚ how can you Resurrect yourself? So there are lots of things‚ which look mythical‚ which are not. Tomorrow they'll say that Christ never Resurrected Himself. And actually‚ He died later on in Kashmir. There's a proof of it‚ but still the people don't want to believe and they just wanted to spread Christianity because they know that if you have majority of people then they can rule.
It is the people who said‚ not in the Bible‚ not in the Christianity‚ but the people started calling Her Madonna and from that Madonna level that people started seeing the Mother and the Motherhood. She was Mahalakshmi. We know that very well and we worship Her as Mahalakshmi. She was Radha. Radha also had a son and He was like an egg. And a half of the egg was Christ and half of the egg was Shri Ganesh. But when this child was born‚ He started crying for His Father. Father was Shri Krishna. It's in the - if we read Devi
Mahatmyam it is there. So always He puts His hands like this‚ towards His Father. So one is‚ as you know‚ is Shri Krishna's finger‚ another is Vishnu's. And She was Ra - dha. 'Ra' means energy‚ 'dha' means the one who has sustained the energy. And She is the one who called Him Jesus. Actually in the Hebrew‚ it is 'Yesu' and also in the - thank God‚ I read the Bible in Marathi‚ which was directly translated from Hebrew - Yesu is the name. Yesu is the name of the Mother of Christ‚ Mother of Shri Krishna 'Yesu' means‚ as we call Her‚ Jesu or Yesu from Jeshoda or Yashoda. From that She called Him. And Christ word comes from Krishna. So She called Him Krist and Yesu or Jesus. We‚ too‚ call Yashoda sometimes Jesu or Yesu.",https://www.amruta.org/p/4210,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12850,,,,"Merry Christmas and all the blessings for the next year. Today we are not going to have a very long puja‚ but there are certain things‚ which we have to understand from the life of Christ. Christ was born in very poor conditions‚ just to show that spirituality can live in any circumstances and under any problems and He had to face so much opposition from His own clan. He was born in a Jew family and that time‚ the Jews would not accept him‚ but they did not kill him‚ that's the main point‚ which we have to understand. They did not kill Him. Under no law a multitude can kill. Is the judge‚ who was a Roman judge from the Roman Empire who actually ordered His death.
It is very difficult to follow His life because He was absolutely a Divine personality‚ absolutely. And that's why He - whatever rules and regulations He has passed for the Christians are really very difficult to follow‚ very difficult. I don't think very few people are even able to follow His life. It's very difficult because He said that if you commit any adultery with your eyes‚ you'd better take it out. You cut your hand if you do any crime with it. For Him‚ the crime was also a very subtle thing. Turn your left cheek if somebody slaps you on the right cheek. To follow this kind of difficult‚ very‚ very difficult thing is impossible. And also He said that‚ 'You have to do it‚ not others.'
He was the greatest Sahaja Yogi‚ but He had so many powers‚ which are difficult for human beings to have. But His sacrifices‚ His adjustments‚ acceptance of whatever was told to Him‚ He accepted. His love for His Mother and on the cross He said‚ 'Behold the Mother!' He just said‚ 'Behold the Mother.'
So we come to another point that we should realise what we are. This is very important for Sahaja Yoga. Christ has said‚ 'I am the Son of God.' All right. He said it openly‚ though people crucified Him for that‚ but He said it. He said it openly‚ 'I am the Son of God. Do what you like.' It was a fact‚ which was the truth He was supposed to say.
 
So now‚ the Sahaja Yogis have to say‚ 'I am the son or daughter of Adi Shakti.' Once you say to yourself that‚ suddenly you'll start changing because it's a very big position. It's a very anointed position. Once you start saying that‚ then you'll start understanding what is your responsibility. You'll be amazed.
Now these Ekadesha Rudras come out of‚ as I told you‚ from the Void. So‚ we can say that the destruction part of it comes from the Void mainly. But these are the powers‚ all are given in one person that is the Maha Vishnu‚ that is Lord Jesus Christ‚ because He is the support of the whole universe. He is the personification of Omkara‚ He is the personification of vibrations. So when He gets angry then the whole universe starts breaking. As He personifies the power of the Mother which is penetrating into every atom‚ into every molecule‚ into every human being‚ into everything that is living and non-living‚ once it gets disturbed the whole thing gets into jeopardy. So the pleasing of Christ is very important. Now‚ Christ has said‚ 'You have to be like small children'‚ that is the innocence. The purity of the heart is the best way you can please Him.",https://www.amruta.org/p/652,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Innocence,,
12860,,,,"First of all‚ He (Christ) was born in a manger. To be born in a manger means in a poor circumstance. That means He showed there's no need to have money or there's no need to have a huge‚ big properties or anything to be impressive on people. Those were the days where people respected the tapasyis‚ the ones who were doing tapasya. That was the time to do tapasya.
So He came on this Earth and lived like a tapasyi. On the contrary‚ the Christians are the most self-indulgent people you can think of. You go to any Christian nation you'll be amazed how they are just slaves of money and their watches. How they are living - it's very shocking to see they are following Christ. 'Yes‚ we follow Christ.' Then follow means what? He's there and you are standing backwards moving. Is that the following?
So‚ today we are talking about Christ. He's sitting in a position of Agnya Chakra controlling pineal and pituitary. By that‚ He controls our conditioning. If we follow Him‚ then we cannot be conditioned by anything because He talked of Spirit only. Spirit cannot be conditioned‚ conditioned by anything. Whatever is good‚ that will be accepted‚ good‚ congenial to the Spirit.
  ...  ...if you see His sermons‚ it's so deep and so enlightened‚ despite the effort of this gentleman‚ Mr. Paul‚ you see Christ talking to people‚ giving them different ways of explanation‚ what happens after Realisation‚ how a seed is sprouted and how it can get spoiled and very beautifully He explained to people.
Actually‚ we have to understand that Christ never started any exclusive religion. Never. None of them. Specially Mohammed Sahib has talked about Abraham. He's talked about Moses. He's talked about Christ and His Mother much more than in the Bible respected Her.
His (Christ's) life was so charming and so beautiful. Like a shooting star‚ He came on this Earth‚ but left such a remarkable impression on people. His crucifixion was a part of the game because He had to make the way in the Agnya Chakra. To cross the Agnya Chakra‚ He was crucified. But His message is not crucifixion. People wear the cross and I feel very hurt about it. He crucified Himself. But that's not the message. That's not [what] you should celebrate‚ that He was crucified. There are people who celebrate it.
You have to celebrate His Resurrection‚ because human beings are to be resurrected. In Sahaja Yoga nobody's crucified and is resurrected because of one crucifixion of Christ. That was enough. That was sufficient. You can't carry the cross on your shoulder. Don't have to. He's carried for you. He's done everything for you. He said also that He died for all the sinners. It's a fact. If He had not done that‚ it would have been difficult to open your Agnyas because two problems‚ I told you‚ this conditioning and ego.
But the pure nature of Christ is Innocence. You know that. He's Shri Ganesh. Shri Ganesh is an eternal child. Christ is also complete innocence because He doesn't react‚ because He's not conditioned.",https://www.amruta.org/p/4190,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Innocence,,
12870,,,,"Today‚ we are celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ. The birth of Jesus Christ is very symbolic because He was born in such a manner that even the poorest of the poor wouldn't be born in the stable. And He was put in the bed which was made of dried grass. He came on this earth to show people that for a person who is an incarnation‚ or who is a highly evolved soul‚ is not bothered about the comfort of the body.
Racialism‚ what was the race of Christ? Was He a fair man? No. Was He a white person? Not at all. What was His colour? He was brown like Indians.
Christ had only twelve disciples‚ except for one or two‚ all of them dedicated‚ without Realisation‚ dedicated fully to the work of Christianity‚ and it spread.",https://www.amruta.org/p/2083,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12880,,,,"I was telling them about Christ‚ what was His power? His power was of love and not of anger - because He is the one who has crossed the most difficult centre - of Agnya.
Why did you come to Sahaja Yoga?   ....you came here to become a great guru‚ as you asked Me - gurupada dijiye. For that you have to have‚ in Sahaja Yoga‚ a complete humility‚ natural humility‚ natural balance - this is what Christ has taught us.
If you have no discipline you can never be a good Sahaja Yogi. From the life of Christ we have to learn these things - that unless and until we have these things we cannot become good Sahaja Yogis.
Look at Christ‚ He took birth in a very humble abode‚ but He was the king. And He lived with the poor‚ and tried to save them. He saved the lepers‚ He saved so many people‚ there were twenty-one people who were cured by Him.
Christ only once went into temper - which He had a right to do - that‚ when He saw people selling things in the temple. That's why Christ took a hunter (scourge) and beat them‚ those who were selling things near the church.
Christ went for a wedding and they had no wine. Now in the Hebrew language wine means the juice of the grapes‚ it doesn't mean fermented. So He converted water into that wine. You cannot convert water instantaneously into wine‚ wine has to rot‚ has to smell‚ the more it smells the better it is. But they think that Christ said you must drink. He never said that‚ He just converted it into wine meaning the taste of the juice of grapes.
Once I went to some television and there was a very nice man‚ in Italy. He said‚ 'Mother you first give me Realisation.' So I said‚ 'Get some water.' I put My hand into it‚ 'Now you
drink it.' He said‚ 'It's tasting like wine‚' I said‚ 'This is what Christ did.' He got his Realisation. Instantaneously you cannot make wine.
But if somebody dies‚ they will drink‚ if somebody is born‚ they will drink. At any cost without drinking they are not normal. But the people who got Realisation have suddenly changed‚ they don't want to drink‚ they've stopped drinking‚ their attention has become nice‚ the whole thing has changed. This is the transformation that has worked‚ of which Christ has talked‚ Mohammed Sahib has talked; everybody has talked about this particular time when people will get transformed.
So for you to understand Christ‚ it's all His qualities you must have. Surrender it‚ surrender your ego‚ all your problems can be solved because as long as there is ego‚ this Divine power doesn't take over. You may do anything‚ you are not connected‚ the connection is missing‚ Christ is missing; He is no more there. To establish Him first of all you must show how you love. That doesn't mean that you love your wife‚ love your children and love your house. You have to love everyone. Try to make everyone happy.
And thanks to Christ that crucified himself‚ sacrificed His body for our sake‚ that our Agnya is opened - otherwise I could not have done this Sahaja Yoga. But in this area (pointing at the Ekadesha Rudra) we have Buddha‚ Christ and Mahavira‚ and they had to do tapasya‚ tapaha‚ they did it. You don't have to do now‚ they have done for you.

12890,,,,There are so many things I would like you to know about Christ‚ but this is a short time in which I cannot tell you‚ the way He had His own priorities. Though in the Bible He's not described fully‚ I should say‚ and whatever it might have been‚ they have reduced it‚ maybe‚ and the way they practice Christianity also is shocking. So one has to learn Christianity through the heart‚ no other way out‚ they should learn through the heart - heart of your Mother.,https://www.amruta.org/p/2629,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12900,,,,"Today‚ long time back‚ Christ was born. You all know the story of His birth and of all the sufferings He had to go through. He's the one who has given us a model of a Sahaja Yogi‚ for He didn't live for Himself‚ in no way‚ but He lived for others‚ working out the Agnya Chakra.
  .... I think Christ has suffered the most. As you know He was endowed with all the powers of Shri Ganesh‚ as He is the reincarnation of Shri Ganesh. The first of them was His innocence. He was the eternal child‚ we should say‚ that He couldn't understand the cruelty and the hypocrisy of this stupid world. Still‚ if you understand‚ what can you do about it? But with great courage He took His birth in a country where people had no idea of spirituality.
I read a book about Him‚ saying that He came to Kashmir where He met one of My forefathers - Shalivahana.
It's written that he asked Christ‚ 'Why have you come to India?' So He said‚ 'This is My country‚ that's why I've come here‚ where people respect spirituality. But I live among people who do not understand spirituality at all.' His conversation with Him (Christ) was very interesting. Because Shalivahana said‚ 'That's all the more reason that You should go back to Your country‚ and teach them Nirmala Tattwam - that's the principle of purification.' He went back‚ and after three and a half years‚ He was crucified.
So from His beautiful life that I've seen‚ we have to learn that unless and until we are realised souls‚ we will be torturing the Spirit of Christ. We have seen it happening‚ all those who talk of Christ. He has said it very clearly‚ 'You'll be calling me Christ‚ Christ - I won't recognise you'. Very clearly He has said it. I don't know why they didn't remove it from the Bible. It means those who will talk‚ and preach‚ and dress up to show off that they are spiritual‚ in the name of Christ‚ He will not recognise them. It's as simple as that.
And this time now when it's the Last Judgement‚ He is going to judge the whole world on the basis of spirituality - which means vibrations. His judgement has already started. I've seen it. You can see in so many countries‚ things are just disappearing. All their ego‚ all their aggressiveness‚ all their cruelties are being challenged. And those who did wrong in the war also are taken to task. So in the history also‚ those who have done wrong to any community‚ to any people‚ they all will be taken to task. They had no business to be aggressive on people and to torture them. This is what is Shri Ganesh's principle acting through Sahaja Yoga.
Christ didn't say that‚ but He did say there will be Last Judgement. On one side He was very kind and compassionate‚ on the other side He was really Shri Ganesh because He took a hunter (scourge) to hit the people who were selling things in the temple. You cannot have business in the name of religion.",https://www.amruta.org/p/19534,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12910,,,,Regarding today's great advent of Shri Jesus Christ‚ I told them that He came on this earth with a very great mission‚ I would say one of the greatest missions; because He wanted to open this Agnya Chakra which was so constricted‚ and could not be done before. For that He had to sacrifice His life. By that sacrifice only‚ the great Agnya could be opened. He was aware of it‚ He knew that it has to happen - that He had to somehow accept this sacrifice. As it is‚ He was a Divine personality. He had no problem in doing so; but He thought that there could be some other way whereby you can open this Agnya Chakra.,https://www.amruta.org/p/4301,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12920,,,,Today we are here to worship Christ as He was resurrected from dead. There are lots of theories about His death‚ but actually He resurrected Himself and then He went down to India and settled there with His Mother. After period of His Resurrection is not described in any books‚ as such‚ but in one of the puranas written about Shalivahan‚ one of the kings of the dynasty I belong to‚ has met Christ in Kashmir and he asked Him‚ 'What's your name?' He said‚ 'My name is Issa.' And then he asked Him also that‚ 'From which country you come‚ which place?' He said‚ 'I come from a country which is foreign to you and to Me and now I'm here in My own country.' That's how He appreciated‚ I think‚ the Indian thing. And then He used to cure people there and His tomb is there and His Mother's tomb also is there.,https://www.amruta.org/p/268,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12930,,,,Today we are doing Easter Puja. Today is a very important day for Sahaja Yogis because Isa-Messiah (Jesus) has shown us that the redemption of human beings is possible‚ and for that redemption we should always put in an effort. One must also understand why He was crucified. He was crucified on the cross and this cross is a symbol of the swastika on the Agnya Chakra. He was crucified and He left His body there only. He told some important things at that time and one most important thing out of this was‚ 'Behold the Mother.' Everybody can interpret it in a different way‚ but it seems He said that He will send us a Shakti (power) who has three channels - Trigunatmika‚ and that is described very beautifully. One of these Shaktis will give us comfort. This comfort giving power in us is Mahakali's power which gives us comfort‚ which cures our diseases‚ which corrects and resolves many questions of our past. The second power‚ which He gave us‚ which He sent to us‚ was Mahasaraswati and to this Mahasaraswati power‚ He called Counsellor‚ the one who will counsel you - that means‚ who helps us to see the form of yoga. With the help of this second power‚ we will get knowledge‚ we will know the subtle knowledge‚ and the third power‚ (Mahalakshmi) with the help of which we will get our redemption.,https://www.amruta.org/p/406,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12940,,,,"You must know that you are all the time protected. Christ is there as your eldest brother‚ I have always said that‚ but also you have your Mother‚ and you have all the ganas and all the angels around you.
So the message of Christ's life is that He forgave all the people who troubled Him. Even He said that‚ 'Oh God‚ please forgive them for they do not know what they are doing'. On the cross He said those things‚ when He was tortured‚ insulted‚ He said these words‚ 'Forgive them‚ have pity‚ have sympathy for them‚ because they don't know what they are doing‚ they are killing the Son of God and what will happen to them?' Where will they go‚ what will be their situation? This one is a big message for us. That even on the cross‚ He said forgive‚ 'Oh God‚ Oh Father‚ forgive them'.
In the same way we have to also forgive people. It is very important from the life of Christ‚ that we have to forgive people. His forgiveness was of the greatest importance for the world to understand‚ you must forgive. If you learn how to forgive you'll be amazed that half of the wars of the world will be finished.
 
Did Christ boast of anything? Never. He never boasted of anything. But when He saw people were selling things in the holy places‚ what did He do? He started beating them with hunters. Because that was wrong - absolutely wrong against the holiness of the place. But He didn't say‚ 'I don't like it'‚ no‚ He just showed His complete disapproval of the whole system of selling things in the temple or in a holy place. People go there to worship. They need a mind which is devoid of money orientation. There should be no money orientation when you are meditating.",https://www.amruta.org/p/266,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12950,,,,"This is one thing to be understood from the life of Christ. He was a very simple‚ poor man‚ son of a carpenter. And to Him‚ money was nothing but an absolutely useless thing. To Him‚ Spirit was everything. And He was preaching and telling people that‚ 'You must have spiritual awakening. Very important. Try to understand that there is life beyond all this and then you should get the best results out of this life‚ which you are just wasting.' He was so intelligent and the way He discussed with all those great fathers from the church about the religion and all that‚ it's amazing how a little boy could understand so deeply about religion.
He was a small boy at that time‚ no doubt‚ but He was a person from the Divine‚ created by the Divine. He was Shri Ganesh. He's Aum. He's knowledge‚ everything.
So the greatest thing about Christ or any one of these great people is that they loved. They loved the people. They loved all human beings. That is what we have to do.
That's what Christ has taught us‚ that He had love for all the human beings and He wanted to prepare them for the Resurrection. He came before Sahaja Yoga came in. If He had not done that job‚ it would have been difficult for Me to achieve it. So He had prepared the stage for Sahaja Yoga.
Now look at Christ and His life. He didn't fight anyone. He didn't argue with anyone and He accepted‚ accepted the death on the cross. He accepted it because He knew that it is for the Resurrection‚ for not only His‚ [but] for the Resurrection of the whole world.
Jesus had a very short life of thirty-three years - what a short life. And He was wandering all the time. While wandering‚ He went to India and how much He worked in His life. So many things were founded after His name‚ so many institutions - this and that.",https://www.amruta.org/p/397,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12960,,,,Today we have come here to worship Jesus Christ and His Mother. It's such a coincidence that the Mother of Christ came and stayed in Turkey. Isn't it surprising that She should come here after the crucifixion of Christ and stayed here. I wonder if He also came with Her later on? But they say then He went to Kashmir and She was also there.,https://www.amruta.org/p/372,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12970,,,,"I'm saying that these three powers have a third‚ these three sounds‚ and that's how this word is created‚ of Om. For a realised soul‚ Om is a most powerful thing. For example‚ if you want to protect yourself‚ the word Om itself can protect‚ and when these three powers combine as Om we say that this only the child or the Son God represents in its purest form Om. That's why in the life of Christ‚ or we can say in the life of a personality that represented the Son of God‚ Om is very important because He embodies that Om within Himself. All these three powers are in Him‚ and in the most innocent form.
What I'm trying to say is this way‚ now you take any other deity‚ any other deity except for this one. Take any other deity‚ you will find they have more of this power‚ of that power. For example‚ if you take say‚ Vishnu‚ who stands for evolution‚ if you take‚ say‚ Brahmadeva‚ He stands for creation. If you take Mahesha‚ He stands for the what you call the superego side. Even if you take Krishna‚ He stands for evolution. But when you rise here‚ then only you find that all these three powers combine here at the Agnya. Till Agnya they are separated. At the Agnya they combine.
That's why it is very important that all theses three powers are controlled by Christ‚ and that's why Jesus Christ is the most important deity as far as Sahaja Yogis are concerned‚ because evolution is all right‚ but the complete co-ordination and protection of a human being is only possible if you have all these three powers in your hands.",https://www.amruta.org/p/4550,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12980,,,,"Now She (Shri Lakshmi) was born in the sea‚ She was born as Neera Ja‚ She was born in the sea on Neera‚ that means water. My name is one of them is Neera as you know‚ out of Nirmala one name is Neera. Nirma and Neera that I've got two names‚ four names I should say the big one is Nirmala. So this Neera part means water‚ that She was born in the sea. That the name of Mary is also the same. Miriam or Mary‚ I don't know how you say in English‚ but Maria‚ it comes from Maree‚ the word Maree. Maree itself comes from the word Mary. So this Mahalakshmi‚ Mary is named as She is because She was born in the sea and that's how Her name was Mary‚ Mariana they call it‚ some people call Her Mariana‚ some call Her Miriam‚ all these words are indicating that She was born in the sea. So She is Mahalakshmi‚ now Mary is Mahalakshmi‚ and Ganesh is the child. Now see how symbolically it works‚ that only in Diwali the Lakshmi and the Ganesh are worshipped‚ only these two persons. Can you understand that?
The symbol of Mahalakshmi for me is Mary‚ for you it is Mahalakshmi is the symbol. As a symbol of Ganesh outside is Christ‚ He symbolises Ganesh‚ so both of them are worshipped only on Diwali‚ actually this is the Christmas this is the real Christmas that was before also‚ and this was the time baby Christ was born‚ not the 25th December‚ no it's a misunderstanding‚ doesn't matter‚ keep it up‚ doesn't matter whenever He was born‚ because there used to be a very big festival‚ and after the festival He was born‚ called as Valanan. I don't know what you call in modern times‚ at the time it was called like that‚ and then this child was born and that was the time Christmas was celebrated‚ it was just with that but somehow it shifted‚ I don't know how it shifted‚ there might be somewhere you'll find out that real Christmas was shifted.",https://www.amruta.org/p/100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many people are now talking‚ 'Christ is going to come. He's going to come on the television.' You can put up anyone there as Christ. How are we going to make it out? By His dress or by some sort of a thing they have done? Most of the paintings of Christ and most of His statues that I've seen are nowhere near Christ‚ nowhere near Christ. See‚ they're horrid things. I don't know what are they. So how will you make it out that this is Christ or not? Or this is some sort of a hocus pocus fellow or some sort of a person who has come just deliberately to delude us from reality. There is no way out‚ to find out what is the truth because we are so much used to material forms - for example‚ our idea of art also is in the same way moulded.
If a seed is miraculous‚ how these flowers‚ for example‚ the particular flowers are only on a particular tree and another are on another tree. How does it happen? Who chooses them? Who puts them in proper shape? Who organizes all that?

13000,,,,And if Surya Chakra at the Agnya level is occupied by Lord Jesus Christ then it is even more essential that the purity of life‚ what you call 'niti'‚ is the morality of life.,https://www.amruta.org/p/3786,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13010,,,,"So this Agnya Chakra is a gate‚ is the door of heaven‚ and everyone has to pass through it. Now on this chakra resides the great incarnation of our Lord‚ Jesus Christ. In our Indian shastras‚ He is called as Maha Vishnu‚ the son of Radhaji. And His essences are made of eleven Rudras‚ means eleven destroying powers. But the governing essence‚ the main essence‚ is that of Shri Ganesh‚ means innocence. So He is the embodiment of innocence. Innocence means complete purity. And His body was not made out of Mother Earth‚ in the sense that He never had a body that was perishable. It is Omkara. So when He died‚ He ascended. That is the fact‚ He ascended‚ and because He was a person made of Omkara. Now as He is the son of Radhaji‚ you can see the relationship between Him and the relationship between other deities very easily. About Maha Vishnu‚ it is written in the Devi Bhagavat.
But who reads Devi Bhagavat? Nobody has time to read these books. Mostly what trash things they read‚ there you cannot find explanation of all these incarnations who have come on this earth. So to understand Jesus Christ‚ you must read Devi Bhagavat.
  ...because Christ has been described very clearly in Devi Bhagavat‚ and we can prove it in the Kundalini‚ that when the Kundalini rises and stops here‚ at the Agnya‚ here‚ you have to say Lord's Prayer‚ otherwise it would not open. To awaken Jesus Christ‚ if you do not awaken Him‚ it would not open. You have to take His name otherwise it would not open‚ proves it was Christ who was ruling. Or even if you take the name of Maha Vishnu‚ it opens. So Maha Vishnu and Jesus Christ are the same. So you must see the proof of it‚ and just because you want to believe that Christ is your own and discard everybody else as heathens‚ you are sadly mistaken. Absolutely you are sadly mistaken.
Now if I have to tell you that Radhaji has created Christ and if you see Christ‚ His fingers are like this. Try to understand. Two fingers like this. One of Krishna and one of Vishnu. And He says‚ 'the Father'. And who is the Father of Christ‚ then? Is Shri Vishnu‚ Shri Krishna. Because in Maha Vishnu's description‚ it is‚ Shri Krishna Himself worshipped His son and said‚ 'You will be the support of the Universe‚ and whosoever will ever worship Me‚ the fruits of that will go to You‚' and He placed Him even higher than Himself. And that you can see that above the Vishuddhi Chakra stands Maha Vishnu. And He is the gate through which everybody has to pass. He (Shri Krishna) actually blessed Him specially and He said‚ 'You will be the support of the universe.' See now you have known that Shri Ganesh stays at Mooladhara Chakra. Mooladhara Chakra means the support of the moola‚ support of the roots. But Christ is placed at the support of the fruit. So the same thing evolves at that point‚ that you become aware of Christ only when your Agnya Chakra opens.
Actually that is what happens when Christ is awakened within you‚ He sucks your karmas‚ He sucks your ego and super ego. He sucks your karmas‚ your sins‚ your conditioning and that is how you become free. This is a very important point which people must know. That‚ that was the great job He did‚ was to establish Himself at the Agnya Chakra to suck these two things. And when He sucks these two‚ when He sucks these‚ then we are above our karmas and our sins. So we don't have to worry about sins and all that.
If they had read anything of the Devi Bhagavat and had told that Maha Vishnu is born‚ then people would have given up this idea that you have to suffer for your karmas. So Indians are still thinking that we have to still suffer for our karmas‚ we should fast‚ we should walk and we should hang ourselves by the nearest tree all the time. This is not needed. What you have to do‚ is to just wait for the moment when the Agnya Chakra will be opened. Keep in the centre.
Even Christ said‚ 'I am the Light‚ I am the path‚' because He is the Omkara. He is the path and He is the door‚ He is the gate. And everybody will have to pass through His gate. He never told lies‚ but they crucified Him. They just crucified Him‚ because Christ could not talk much and whatever He said was written down by His disciples the way they understood. To understand Christ you have to have your Realisation.",https://www.amruta.org/p/563,,,,,,,,Agnya,,,Ganesha,,,Shri Krishna,,,Christ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But for others it is too much to believe in the Immaculate Conception or they are all arguing and saying all kinds of nonsensical things‚ because Ganesh was created like that and also Christ could be created like that. Agnya.
So Radha‚ She was Mother Mary and it is surprising‚ if you read the Devi Mahatmaya‚ in that‚ it's clearly written who was Christ‚ that He was the support. He was Maha Vishnu. He was the support. That's the Mooladhara. He was the Support of the Universe. All these were all related people‚ but we are stupidly fighting because we do not have the knowledge of reality. So Radhaji wanted to give Him the name Yeshoda. So She called Him Jesu‚ in Hebrew it is Jesu‚ also in India‚ Yashoda is called just as Jashoda. Many people call it Jesu. That's how He became Jesus.

They are protected‚ looked after and nourished by Shri Vishnu and‚ whenever He finds human beings falling down in their dharma‚ He takes His birth on this Earth. Ultimate stage is the Virat. At that stage‚ this Vishnu principle divides into two. One goes to Virat‚ another to Viratangana. But the third principle is what you call as the Maha Vishnu‚ which incarnated as Lord Jesus Christ.

13180,,,,"Today we are going to do the Puja of Adi Shakti. It's a difficult subject to talk about Adi Shakti‚ because it's not easy to understand that Adi Shakti is the power of Sadashiva. Sadashiva is the God Almighty. She is His breath‚ as they some people call it. Some say She is the desire and some say that She's the entire power of Sadashiva‚ and Sadashiva cannot do anything without Her powers.
This subject has been described by many people in various books in different ways. But actually we need not go to the background of the creation of Adi Shakti‚ for that at least you'll need seven lectures (Shri Mataji smiles). But we'll come to the point when Adi Shakti started working on this Mother Earth.
The first thing is we must know‚ that She created a Kundalini in the Mother Earth itself and She created Shri Ganesha out of the Mother Earth‚ it's very interesting. So the Mother Earth becomes a very important thing for us. If we do not know how to respect the Mother Earth‚ we do not know how to respect ourselves.
The expression of Adi Shakti within you is the Kundalini‚ no doubt. That is the reflection of Adi Shakti in you. But the reflection in the Mother Earth is also expressed‚ as you all know‚ in different places‚ different countries‚ different cities‚ as the manifestation of chakras and Adi Shakti's creations. It was very important first to create a very holy Mother Earth for human beings to be born on that. So the reflection of the Adi Shakti as Kundalini first was on the Mother Earth. Kundalini is‚ we should say‚ is a wee part of the Adi Shakti‚ or we can say that She is the desire‚ pure desire‚ of the Adi Shakti.
So Adi Shakti is the desire‚ complete desire of Sadashiva; and Kundalini‚ Adi Kundalini is the desire‚ complete desire of Adi Shakti. Now this one was first expressed in the Mother Earth‚ inside the Mother Earth. Inside the Mother Earth‚ the Kundalini came up in such a way that it cooled down the inner part of the Mother Earth as much as it could‚ and then it manifested on the surface of the earth as different chakras. So it's tremendous similarity that we have with Virata‚ the Mother Earth and the human beings. If all of them are being reflected by the Adi Kundalini so there has to be a great connection between them. It is not understood by human beings how they are connected to this Mother Earth. This Kundalini passed through different centers‚ creating different centers in the Mother Earth and ultimately broke through Kailasha. And I don't know how many have you been to Kailash you'll see tremendous vibrations flowing out of Kailash.",https://www.amruta.org/p/1730,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So with you‚ all your problems are also gone into Me‚ all your troubles also have gone into Me. But by absorbing it‚ see‚ it's like ocean into which you are put and you are cleansed. But what about the ocean? Ocean has got still your problems and things lingering and they are very troublesome. So the best thing would be for you to cleanse yourself.

Did they have any understanding of Kundalini? Did they have any love for others‚ that they should give them realization? There were some Sufis‚ they never gave realization to anyone.

Christ never gave realization to anybody. Anybody. Krishna did not do it‚ Rama did not. Nobody – but you can do it! You can do it and you know everything about Kundalini. It's a very big thing because you are children of the Adi Shakti. You are here and your Mother is here. It's a very‚ very fortunate thing for Me that you are here.

He has already written a book with all the algebraical complications of what he wanted to prove. He said there is a vacuum. Beyond the consciousness‚ there is vacuum; and in that vacuum only‚ you can know the reality and once all this becomes the reality‚ it is a science – and that's how it is made into science.
He showed so many of my photographs – especially the one where a lot of energy is coming out of my Sahasrara – when we were on a boat. So he said: ""She is the source of all the cosmic energy"" – and that's what Adi Shakti is. She's the one who creates everything. ",https://www.amruta.org/p/1715,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13230,,,But Adi Shakti is not fully the Kundalini‚ we can say - Kundalini is a part of it,"So first thing She does is to create Shri Ganesha and She's settled down. Then She goes up‚ of course in the body of the Virata‚ and then She goes round and goes up on the right hand side – in the other way and there She creates all the universes‚ as you call them‚ Bhuvanas [worlds]. One universe‚ there are 14 Bhuvanas‚ means‚ many‚ many universes make one Bhuvana. And She creates all these things on the right hand side. Then She goes up and then She descends down creating all the chakras – Adi chakras or the pitas.
She comes down‚ makes all these pitas and then She settled as the Kundalini. But Adi Shakti is not fully the Kundalini‚ we can say‚ the Kundalini is a part of it. The rest of the work is much more than this. So‚ although we call it the residual energy‚ means after going through all this journey‚ then She comes round and She goes as Kundalini. Because of this Kundalini and the chakras‚ She creates an area‚ which we call as the chakras in the body. Now first She creates these chakras in the head – we call them the pitas of the chakras. And then She comes down and creates these chakras‚ which are in the body of the virata.
Now‚ once this has happened‚ then She creates human beings. But not directly – through the evolutionary process‚ She goes through‚ and that's how the evolution starts and then it starts developing from the minute‚ small little microscopic organisms in the water and then it starts evolving. So when She creates water‚ and She creates all the universes‚ She chooses this mother earth as the best place to play Her evolutionary process and there She makes this little microscopic thing. Of course I have written all about it and when my book will be released you can see that how first hydrogen‚ carbon and oxygen and all of these things were mixed up and how nitrogen comes into play and how a living process starts. All this I have done in another book that I am going to write now. I mean‚ I have mostly finished but there are some more chakras are to be dealt with.",https://www.amruta.org/p/1715,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13240,,,We have got a place for the Adi Shakti,"But only Indian philosophy had the mother and the Indians are actually shakti worshippers. So this is how it was kept up and brought to this position now. That people have got full idea as to mother principle that has worked out everything.
On this Mother Principle‚ in India people are very sure that it's the mother who does everything and thus we have in India many‚ we should say‚ many Swayambu's‚ means things that are created of the mother earth. For example‚ you know in Maharastra we have got Mahakali's place‚ Mahasaraswati‚ Mahalaxmi and also we have got a place for the Adi Shakti. Some people who have been to Nasik must have seen Chaturshringi. How many people have been to Chaturshringi out of you? It's good. So this Chaturshringi represents the Adi Shakti. Adi Shakti which is the fourth dimension of this power which gives you the ascent and ultimately through Mahalakshmi channel only you get your Realization.",https://www.amruta.org/p/1715,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But now the further work has to be done through you people because you are the channels‚ you are the ones who have to transform people.

13270,,,So‚ Shiva is the God Almighty – we should call him as Sadashiva.,"It's only the word Brahma‚ we can say. You can think of an energy‚ if you want to‚ an energy-form that exists. But the energy accumulates at a point and forms a nucleus. The energy that thinks‚ energy that is distributed‚ accumulates at a point‚ concentrates on a point‚ you can say‚ and this point is the point we call as Sadashiva.
This happens because that energy desires‚ thinks‚ organises‚ loves. When it wants to create‚ when the desire is felt in that energy to create‚ at that time a nucleus is created. This nucleus we call as Sadashiva. This nucleus does not disappear. You can think of a nebula. I mean‚ it is something which is all relative you can think‚ you cannot think something in absolute form. So‚ with thinking you cannot conceptualise the whole thing‚ but if you can think of a state‚ where it's just an energy and no creation. But not the energy of electricity‚ magnetism – all these things. Is the combination‚ the synthesis of all the things which goes into laya which becomes that‚ dissolves into that. It coagulates on a point‚  that may be a [suitable] word‚  coagulates at a point which we can call as a nucleus. This point we call as Sadashiva. This Sadashiva is the Ishwara‚ is the God Almighty.
We call it now ""God"" because now it has a limitation. In the sense that we can call it something. But if it is just an energy we just call it a Brahma. You can say like this: when the water becomes ice‚ a follicle of ice is formed‚ you can differentiate between the water and the ice‚ but still‚ it's a relative‚ relative understanding.
At this state God Almighty‚ Parameshwara‚ takes its form as an identity. That's why we can say that it is not Brahma‚ but an identity. Identity has its aura‚ has its aura‚ we can say‚ its light. This light is the Divine Love.
It goes into various forms but Sadashiva remains as He is.
Now‚ the desire to create is transferred to the aura. The aura is the Power of God‚ Shakti. Ishwara has certain things beyond Him also and before Him. God Almighty has something beyond Him that He cannot control: one‚ He cannot control His eternal nature. It is His nature to be eternal‚ He cannot stop it. He will go on changing His form‚ it is His nature‚ it just… it is His swabhava. He cannot change it‚ His eternal nature. He will be eternally. Eternity is His temperament‚ His nature‚ He cannot overcome that.
For example‚ God cannot take away your freedom to choose the Truth. He cannot. Once He has granted‚ He's not going to take it away. You have to choose it in all your freedom. He will not force you to take it. Many people have hopes like that – they are sadly mistaken. At this juncture only lies the problem of complete destruction or complete resurrection. It is left into the hands of human beings to decide whether they want to accept the Truth or if they want to follow the falsehood. So‚ you have [been] given complete freedom to choose.
I won't go into the details about God Almighty‚ because it's a very subtler subject and requires much more attention. I have talked about it before to many people and all His nature‚ they know that. But He is the Witness‚ He is the Sakshi (witness) in the form of a Sakshi. What is He witnessing? He is witnessing the Creation. And the power that creates the Creation is the Shakti‚ is His power‚ is His consort. Now‚ for us‚ human beings‚ we don't understand that a wife and a husband could be that one (unified). For example‚ you can understand like a Sun and a sunlight‚ Moon and the Moonlight – as these two things are one and the same. Or the meaning and the word. In the same way‚ Shiva and Shakti are one together. For example‚ you can be a father‚ you can be a mother. You can be a father‚ you can be a brother‚ you can be a son – three things you are doing together. In the same way‚ you can be your Self and your power. You know: you and your Self and your power are different‚ but you are one. You have a power to write‚ but you are not your power. Neither your power is your Self. In the same way‚ Shiva and Shakti are two persons to be identified‚ but they are part and parcel of one uniform thing known as 'Brahma'.
But these horrible Tantrikas – again they come round here – have spoiled the relationship between Shiva and Shakti. Not that they were human beings‚ that's why they established all these funny ideas and talked about these nonsensical things. Because they are the people who are nothing but their sex-points. They are nothing nobler than that. They are very depraved and diseased and debased people. They suffer from such a terrible disease that no way they can see anything else but this. Ashvameda has also described as something to do with sex. Everything they look‚ they see sex there. It's like a person‚ as we call it in Hindi – [HINDI 13:00 mins] – who is wearing the glass of sex and watching through that life‚ everything becomes sex‚ sex‚ sex‚ they are such debased and horrible depraved people‚ even God‚ they are bringing to that level. Unless and until they are bringing to that level‚ they cannot exist. How will they justify themselves‚ the way they are? Sex has nothing to do with Shiva and Shakti. What is Sun and sunlight? Is there any sex involved there? Is there nothing existing without sex for these horrible tantrikas? Is there no relationship that exists without sex?
So‚ Shiva is the God Almighty – we should call him as Sadashiva.",https://www.amruta.org/p/807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13280,,,,"I'll try to draw a little bit‚ let us see how it works out.
Now forming into a nucleus like this.
Now‚ this is the remains of the nucleus‚ you can say‚ which forms its power here into a valaya. How does it form? He moves supposing backwards‚ you can say. Then what happens when he moves backwards…kara noko (marathi: don't do that)…this‚ whole thing like this‚ remains here and all of this passes‚ forms a shell around it and the waves cross over and settle onto the shell – here. Now‚ this is the situation: when all inside forms another nucleus here by concentration – this is the Shakti. And this is the Sadashiva. This is the Mahashakti‚ you can say 'Adi Shakti' and this is the Sadashiva.
Now here‚ Shiva‚ once the Shakti forms Her personality‚ or we can say‚ Her ego is established‚ She is a different identity from Shiva. Because the whole process is to create the play for the witness to see. He is the One who is going to watch the play. She is the One who is going to create it. So‚ She accumulates Her ego onto a point here and becomes Shakti‚ assumes a position there. And the first thing She does as a Shakti is to go round in a parabolic…in a parabola around Her Lord.
This point one must understand. She is a Shakti‚ is the Power of God. And the whole Creation is only meant for God Almighty to be seen. He's the only spectator of the play of Shakti. And if He doesn't like the play‚ for example‚ He doesn't like the way it is or the way people are that are created‚ He can immediately stop the play by closing His eyes‚ by denying the play‚ by showing His annoyance or by His stopper‚ He can just stop it. That's why He is also called as a destroyer. But the whole thing is meant for His amusement. And if it doesn't give Him pleasure‚ He can stop it. That's why the first one who must be pleased is the One who is the spectator. Because of this‚ Shiva is garlanded by Her‚ is a parabola and that's why parabola is the symbol of Adi Shakti. This is sort of a certificate to Her‚ a sort of a granting Her the varadan‚ as we call it in Sanskrit language‚ is the varadan that 'go ahead with your work.' This is a sanction given to Him. When She completes this parabola‚ the sanction has been granted and that's why She is a parabola.
Here the question of men dominating the women and women dominating the men does not come in‚ because this is predominantly in our heads‚ you see. When we think of it‚ we think of men and women‚  it is nothing of the kind. It's just complete Oneness. Can we think of one couple which is absolutely united with each other? We cannot. Because we are all incomplete people. But if you could stretch your imagination to such a point that both of them are meant for each other only and the One who is active‚ is the Adi Shakti‚ is only active to please the God Almighty Who is the only spectator of Her play and He's to be pleased first. So‚ She surrenders Herself before Him‚ takes the sanction through the parabola.
Now‚ parabola is a very important thing. You know that everything travels through parabola‚ never in a straight line. For example‚ if you love someone‚ our love goes round that person and comes back to us as love. But if you hate that person‚ then our hatred goes round that person and comes back to us as a terrible hatred. So‚ the parabola is taken‚ but you might say 'why a parabola?' The question can be: ""Why should there be a parabola and not a circle?"" The reason is: parabola is the shortest distance to go round another point‚ is the shortest. And that's why it's a parabola.
It is even in our ordinary life‚ you will find this happening: that whatever you do to others‚ it comes back to you in some form‚ whether you do good or bad. And that's why our karmic ideas and that of our doing punyas are all there. Because whatever we emit through us‚ will come back to us. In the same way‚ if you bless the whole world‚ the blessings of the whole world will come to us.",https://www.amruta.org/p/807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13290,,,She pushes Herself towards Him and He pushes Her back and disappears‚ opening out from here. ,"As I told you‚ the process is not that simple as it can be drawn‚ because it's a living process of a big dimension but I'm just trying to make it simpler for you to understand. Now‚ this parabola‚ when‚ here now‚ when She is‚ She goes into the motion of a parabola and Shiva sanctioned Her‚ sanctions Her – it's a living process‚ again you must understand‚ it's a living process‚ it's as human as we are. Both of them are as human as we are‚ we should say‚ they are thousand times more human than we are.
So‚ here the Wife‚ His Consort‚ says that: ""I am very happy just like this. I won't go any further with it."" Because Creation is not an easy thing for Her‚ She doesn't want to depart from Her Creation. Creation is the child and She says‚ ""I would not like to have children now‚ because I will lose you."" So‚ She pushes Herself towards Him and He pushes Her back and disappears‚ opening out from here.
Now She is in this form. So‚ the beginning of the Om starts. Parabola‚ first of all‚ gets converted into Om. Then She pushes Herself down and settles down for a while to meditate and to find out how She is going to work it out‚ we can say like this.
You see‚ it is Her desire which must be aroused. If Her desire is not aroused‚ She will not conceive the Creation. So‚ a kalpa is spent in that. Quite a lot of time is spent in Her own thinking – which way She should do it. She has created many universes. It is not one universe She has created. She has created universes after universes and I will show you how She has created so many universes. And some of them are still lingering on‚ some of them are destroyed. But today before us: this Universe‚ this Earth‚ on this Earth‚ India and in India‚ Delhi‚ you are sitting attending this place. It's like that.
So‚ at this moment‚ whatever is the thing‚ is not the past‚ nor the future‚ but I'm telling you about the present moment we are here. But many universes have been created by Adi Shakti; even before us. And She has tried many other things also. Ultimately She has tried this. She has created Earth and then created us. Now‚ how She has done that we'll see later on. Just now let us see how She assumes her powers.
When She decides to create‚ She is endowed with three powers: She has three powers of God which are granted to Her. By one power‚ first of all‚ is the existence‚ the desire to exist‚ She desires to exist with God. The second power is to create and the third power is to sustain. First power is existence‚ second is to create and the third is the evolving power or sustenance power by which gradually you sustain something and you become something. These are the three powers She assumes.",https://www.amruta.org/p/807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13300,,,Actually‚ Her three movements‚  of Mahakali‚ Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati‚ are all the time with Her‚ with the Adi Shakti.,"Now‚ She uses again Her parabolic systems. You know‚ supposing‚ I have come to this house by this way‚ I know this way. Then I take that way‚ I know that way. I know the middle way‚ everything. Now‚ I know these three ways and I know all about it: with that knowledge‚ I can do something else. So‚ She again uses Her parabolic movements. Actually‚ Her three movements‚  of Mahakali‚ Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati‚ are all the time with Her‚ with the Adi Shakti. She can separate them and put them into three different channels. She can combine them and synthesise them and use it as a parabola – you understand this? That's why when we put a bandhan to you‚ we say ""put a parabola‚"" is a parabola‚ because the vibrations are all in… all the three powers are flowing this way.
So‚ we have got‚ you know that‚ three powers – the Mahakali power you can say‚ I need not write‚ ""Mahakali power"". By Mahakali power She desires‚ as I've told you‚ is the emotional side of God‚ you can say. She represents the emotional side of God‚ She desires. Is the desire is that of God. God Almighty‚ Who is the spectator‚ He is the Sakshi. And She puts that Sakshi into your heart‚ She reflects that into your heart which is kept all the time burning to watch what you are doing. To see your play after your creation.
Her Mahasaraswati power‚ now‚ moves in a parabola. She can move in any angle‚ 360 angles She can move‚ from one point. Sometimes‚ She goes round and round at a point. When She goes round and round at a point‚ Her Mahasaraswati power can get consolidated; you can say‚ it becomes dense. You see‚ that's the trouble with English language! It becomes dense‚ it becomes so very dense that it cracks out. These cracks occur due to the momentum of the movement of the Mahakali power‚ Mahasaraswati power. Because it is moving in a round and round fashion‚ they also get into the momentum of that movement‚ they start moving. For example‚ this part starts moving‚ this part starts moving‚ this part starts moving. And when they start moving‚ they become rounds‚ they lose their angularities and then they become round.  Now I'm telling you‚ very much in short because it's a…they become round. These rounds again are put into friction with each other. And that is how‚ we can say – now forget about other universes‚ where other styles were also created – but about this one we can say‚ was created",https://www.amruta.org/p/807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13310,,,So‚ one of these then again cracks and becomes a surya-mandal‚ and a surya-mandala has got‚ as you know‚ Earth and Moon and all these things,"Now‚ you must all the time remember that this Power thinks‚ understands‚ organises‚ loves and is an identity. So‚ She creates the Earth. Earth is not created so easily. Part of the Sun is removed just like this‚ with the hand‚ you can say. We must understand why the Sun became so cold. Sun is‚ from the Sun it is removed very much far away first‚ to the farthest point so that it freezes completely. Also like Moon‚ it was taken very far away. It just freezes completely and is then brought near the Sun again‚ like a pendulum. It is moved again towards the cold side‚ again it is brought to the hot side. It is brought to a point‚ to the medium point where Earth is made‚ is made – again I'm saying‚ it's not a chance of nature – is made deliberately‚ habitable for human beings‚ the temperature was brought in. It has been done by Adi Shakti‚ the Mother. She has done it deliberately‚ it's not easy to conceive of such a Mother. But She has done it. And She brings this Earth to a point where life can begin.
So the combination of Moon and the combination of Sun gives you hydrogen from the Moon‚ oxygen from the sun‚ gives you water‚ the freezing and heating. The freezing and heating gives you the water. In the water‚ when the Earth is made‚ spirally‚ to move upward‚ again the heating and cooling starts. By heating and cooling‚ life comes into being as amino-acids.
Is done deliberately! What I am saying: it is not done by something‚ by chance. On this also one has to think once: ""How is it?"" It is not chance! If you read  Du Nouy [Pierre Lecomte Du Nouy (1883-1947)] ‚ is a very big biologist‚ I mean‚ I think he's one of the greatest biologists who has really gone into the calculations of how much time should it take for a simple amoeba to be created out of the matter and he has calculated that it should take much more time than even what we have had so far – billions of billions of years are needed just by chance. Law of chance is there‚ which I don't know if I should tell you elaborately‚ but law of chance is that‚ if you have in one tube 50 red pebbles and 50 white pebbles and if you start shaking them and make them absolutely in a chaotic order‚ it takes so much‚ so much times shaking to make it again the same as it is‚ or to bring it into order.
So‚ even to create an orderly living protoplasm‚ a cell‚ would have taken much more time than it has taken so far: much more‚ many times more‚ billions of billions. And it has taken only 5 billion years for Earth to secede from the Moon. And only 2 billion years for it to cool down. So‚ he says‚ it is beyond any understanding – only thing that can explain it‚ what we can say‚ is that there is a 'Juggler' behind it. And there is a Juggler‚ about which our great rishis and munis know that – that Juggler is nobody else but Adi Shakti‚ the Primordial Mother. The Primordial Father is Sadashiva and the Primordial Mother is Adi Shakti. And are we going to discuss about their sex? Are we going to do that way with the tantrikas? Is that the way to pay homage to your parents? We have to understand that it's a very‚ very solemn subject‚ we are discussing here the sanctum sanctorium of the love of our Primordial Parents. It's a very‚ very holy thing. We are not holy people‚ we are yet full of lots of greed and lust‚ but they are above everything. So‚ when we are discussing them‚ we have to know‚ we have to do it with great shraddha‚ and with our head bowed before them that it is our luck and we are very fortunate that we have been able to learn something about these two Primordial Parents who have brought forth this Creation‚ their child.
So‚ one of these then again cracks and becomes a surya-mandal‚ and a surya-mandala has got‚ as you know‚ Earth and Moon and all these things and I have told you how Earth is created. After the Creation of Earth‚ first‚ you know that amino-acids were formed‚ the vegetation started and then the human being started.",https://www.amruta.org/p/807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13320,,,Love is the message of Adi Shakti,"Why did Adi Shakti create this world? Why did all this happen‚ why don't we think why so much of love‚ so much of prosperity has been given to us? We never realise where are we and how much we have got. It's not the money but the love and when you'll understand you'll really love each other and there is no hatred‚ there is no revenge‚ nothing but just love and love and love. This is what is the message of today. We all have to be loving each other.

We have to have all kinds of rituals but it is only expression of our love‚ it's not just a ritual‚ it is love‚ when you have love of the Mother how do you express? In the same way we have to know that today we have to promise that for us love is the most important. We should love. People don't even love in their own families. I'm not talking to such people I know‚ they love their own families‚ their own village‚ their own surroundings‚ everywhere.

But still the world is still going on with wars‚ fighting and all kinds of troubles. The whole world has to come up to love each other‚ there is no other solution but to love. And in that love there is no selfishness but enjoyment‚ and that enjoyment you should feel and give it to others. I am sure you all Sahaja yogis are doing that and you are seeing the mistakes of the others and not to get anybody into trouble.

Love is the message of Adi shakti. Now you think about it. One Adi shakti created the whole world. How she must have done it. What she must have planned. How she must have organised. It is not a easy thing. Only because she loved. Love is the expression that you are all there. That is why to be one with Her one should learn to love. Of course in that you have to know that you should forgive. If you don't know how to forgive and find mistakes of other people you won't help. What is your now job is‚ is to see that you are loving‚ no hatred for anyone‚ you don't think of hating anyone and hitting somebody. This has to work out.

13330,,,Soil of India has fragrance,"So today I'm going to tell you about Adi Shakti which is a very‚ very ancient subject. Adi Shakti is the power of God Himself and She created this world to bring His kingdom on this Earth.

You can imagine it was‚ there was nothing but darkness and out of this darkness She had to create all these beautiful‚ picturous trees and all kinds of vegetation. That She did create. But what is the use having all these things which do not speak‚ do not understand? There's no manifestation with them. Of course some of the trees and some of the flowers do receive beautiful vibrations and they grow very well‚ but not all‚ some of them.

For example I must tell you that here flowers have no fragrance‚ all the flowers they have no fragrance. I've been going around to see if there were flowers of fragrance. But what they do is to grow them big; they're very big‚ much bigger than you can find them anywhere. But there is no fragrance. While in a poor country like India‚ the flowers have tremendous fragrance. Even small flowers have tremendous fragrance.
 
Now what is the speciality of the fragrance in India and nowhere else? Nowhere.
 
Some flowers may be having little fragrance but there is no fragrance in the flowers that are grown so very beautifully‚ full of love and care. But lots of wild flowers also in India have got fragrance. What is the reason? They say that the soil of India has fragrance. How can you have fragrance in the soil? But it is a fact. What I'm saying is not just a story but is a fact that in India any flower that you grow mostly‚ has mostly‚ has fragrance. While here that's not the case. Neither it is in any other country‚ you go to Norway or you go to Germany‚ any other country you go you won't find any fragrance in the flowers. It is very shocking why there is no fragrance in flowers.

When this world was created there was no fragrance but in some areas there was‚ specially areas which we call as India and otherwise. It is unbelievable that here or anywhere abroad there are no flowers with fragrance.",https://www.amruta.org/p/1552,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But She again coils down due to the pressure of the burden and then they even forget that the peace‚ serenity and cool vibrations etc. which they had once received are no more with them.

If there was no energy in the matter how can you have all chemical compounds. Who pushes them? Say sodium chloride; sodium and chloride are attached to each other.

We know water has energy‚ that""s how we have hydrostatics‚ even stones‚ gold - all of them have got energy in themselves. It is all controlled by the principle of Shri Ganesha. Though such a tiny little child how great is his work and how much He has to work out. From matter‚ one moves to living plants‚ then to animals‚ then to human beings and everywhere His energy works.

13410,The Science of God,,Rising of the Kundalini along Ida and Pingla Nadis and making four loops,"""God has created fourteen levels within us. If you simply count them‚ then you know that there are seven Chakras within us. Besides these‚ there are two more Chakras‚ about which you do not talk much. They are the Chakra of Moon (Lalita) and Chakra of Sun (Shri). Then there is ""Hamsa"" Chakra. Thus‚ there are three more. Seven plus three makes ten. Then there are four Chakras above the Sahasrara. And about these Chakras also I have told you; Ardhabindu‚ Bindu‚ Valay‚ and Pradakshina. These are the four. After coming to Sahaja Yoga and after your Sahasrara has opened‚ you have to pass through these four Chakras‚ Ardhabindu‚ Bindu‚ Valay and Pradakshina. After passing through these four Chakras only‚ you can say that you have become a Sahaja Yogi.
And if you see from another angle‚ we have to cross fourteen stages in reaching up to Sahasrara. If you divide them then there are seven Chakras situated on the Ida Nadi and seven on the Pingla Nadi. When man makes his ascent‚ he does not do so in straight direction. He comes first to the left and then goes to the right‚ then again to left and then again to right. And when Kundalini ascends‚ it also does so‚ dividing Herself into these two. The reason for it can be understood if I take the example of two ropes. These two ropes together‚ side by side in the process of going up or coming down cross over twice. (Shri Mataji explains the rising of the Kundalini along Ida and Pingla Nadis and making four loops - two each in opposite directions‚ clockwise and anticlockwise - at every Chakra) When Kundalini ascends‚ you see on the Chakra whether the left is caught or the right is caught. Although the Kundalini is only one‚ but on every Chakra you see both the things - thus you know whether left is caught or the right. 
Thus within us‚ if each Chakra is divided into these two‚ left and right‚ then seven twos are fourteen. Similarly within us first of all‚ fourteen stages have to be crossed before reaching the Sahasrara. And‚ if you understand this‚ that‚ these seven and seven above‚ this way also a path of fourteen is created. Therefore‚ this thing ""fourteen"" is very important in Kundalini Shastra‚ very important. We should fully understand that we become entitled to the blessings of Sahaja Yoga only after rising above these fourteen stages.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/345,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13430,The Science of God,,It is easy to say there is no God‚ but very difficult to explain many things without saying that there is God,"   ...  ....Every scientist who is open-minded can see for himself that this universe is a beautiful cosmos‚ is very well organized and has run very smoothly and can also deduce that the creation of this particular universe has led to the creation of this Mother Earth.
About five billion years back‚ this Mother Earth‚ which was in gaseous form condensed and well cooled down‚ how was it cooled down to the extent it did? Scientists accept this fact just as it is. They cannot find out because they have limitations. Why this thing happened? How it was started?
It is easy to say there is no God‚ but very difficult to explain many things without saying that there is God. That is‚ the time that was taken for this universe to create a human being‚ is so very short‚ that nothing else can explain it.
If you use the law of chance‚ we can find out how many times the permutations and combinations have to work to create even a living cell. For example‚ in a test tube if you have fifty red pills and fifty white pills‚ all arranged in such a manner that all the red ones are at the bottom and that white ones are at the top. You have to go on shaking them and the arrangement of the pills gets disorganized completely. Then to organize it back fully into the original arrangement‚ how many times one has to shake?
They have discovered a formula‚ that isn""t raised to power something. According to this formula‚ if human beings are created by chance‚ it seems an impossibility because the time that is taken so far is so short that only‚ at the most maybe‚ some living cell could have been created.
Why a complicated human being has been created and so beautifully it is organized within him‚ that it is hard to believe that some juggler was not behind the show. There must have been some scientist who has achieved these results. It could have only been possible by some special hand to do these things. I mean if there was no organisation‚ no thinking‚ no planning‚ no powerful personality‚ The Almighty behind it‚ it could not have been possible.
As science has its limitations‚ of course‚ we cannot find out how was it expedited‚ how it took place? Because we can see that we have achieved something in the field of science‚ by one method‚ perhaps similar to one that was used to trigger our evolution so fast.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/4556,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He penetrates into everything. He penetrates into the - what do you call that – anu‚ renu‚ paramanu‚ three things – atoms. Into little atoms it goes and it shakes them. Now‚ if you ask any scientist‚ he""ll tell you that there is an asymmetric‚ symmetric vibration even in atoms. Now‚ how can this energy be existing there? Because He can penetrate into anything and because of this‚ He""s so penetrating‚ that He encompasses everything: into matter‚ into animals‚ into human beings‚ into Realized Souls He penetrates. In the matter it is just a vibrations‚ in the animals it is just a guiding force‚ its tremendous guiding force.
Like birds from Siberia flying down to Australia: who gives them the sense of direction? We never think about it. There are so many things animals are doing. They have such a sense of understanding. Like a tiger in the‚ say‚ in the forest: all the animals know that there is a tiger in the forest‚ they are all quiet‚ respecting their king. He kills‚ say one cow or could be some animal‚ they just respect him. The thing what he has killed is left for one day‚ nobody touches it. See the protocol: now when he comes back next day‚ he eats to his own satisfaction‚ then the tigress‚ then the children‚ they eat. Once they have finished with it‚ then one by one‚ in the order of protocol‚ all the animals eat that animal‚ the last of all are crows which are perhaps vegetarians‚ I should say. But the protocol is maintained. If a lion is sitting‚ you can make it out there won""t be even a little sound anywhere. So‚ it guides the animals and animals keep their character. They are not like human beings. For example‚ a snake is a snake and a tiger is a tiger. But human beings can be snake‚ tiger‚ leopard - anything together. They might be dogs‚ they might be small little worms‚ they could be anything. Combinations of so many things‚ because they have passed through these Yonis‚ as they call them‚ these species.

13500,The Science of God,,  ...you can see Sahasrara as a burning bundle of flames.,"""So‚ this last center‚ the Sahasrara‚ is contained in the limbic area of the brain. Our head is like a coconut. The coconut has the hair‚ and then a hard nut and then a black covering and inside is white shell of coconut and inside is the space‚ the water. In the same way‚ our brain is made. That""s why coconut is called as Shriphala‚ is the fruit of the power that is Shri. Shri power is the Right side power and the Left side power is the Lalita power. So‚ we have two Chakras – Left side‚ here is the Lalita and Right side‚ here is the Shri Chakra. These two Chakras are working out the Right side Maha Swaraswati""s power and Left side Mahakali""s powers.
Now‚ the central power is the Kundalini. That has to rise and penetrate through different Chakras‚ enter into the limbic area and enlighten the seven Pithas – seats of these seven Chakras. So‚ it penetrates through six Chakras‚ enters into the limbic area‚ and enlightens all the seven Pithas in the brain‚ which are placed along the mid-line of the limbic area. So‚ we start it from the back‚ placed here at the back‚ is the Mooladhara Chakra. Around it is the Swadishthana‚ and then is the Nabhi‚ then the Heart‚ then the Vishuddhi and then the Agnya. So‚ all these six centers are combining to make the seventh center. This is a very important point‚ which we should know. Now‚ the Shri Chakra is the Right side working and the Lalita Chakra is the Left side working. So‚ when the Kundalini doesn""t rise then we do with our Right side our physical and mental activities. So our brain is doing Right side activity and that""s why our brain is like Shriphala. Sahasrara is actually the assemblage of these six Chakras and is a hollow space; on the sides of it there are one thousand Nadis. And when the light penetrates into the limbic area‚ then the enlightenment of these Nadis take place and you can see them as flames‚ very gentle flames burning and these flames have all the seven colors that you see in the ""VIBGYOR"". But the last one ultimately becomes again integrated and it is a crystal clear flame. All these seven lights ultimately become crystal clear. So‚ you have Sahasrara with one thousand petals‚ as they called it‚ but if you cut the brain in a transverse section or horizontal section‚ you will be able to see that all these nerves are built like this along the limbic area. All of them are like a petal‚ and if you cut it like this‚ (vertically) you will find that there are many nerves in every bundle of nerves. So‚ when it is enlightened‚ you can see Sahasrara as a burning bundle of flames.
This is a very deep subject. So when the enlightenment of the Kundalini takes place in the brain‚ then the truth is perceived through your brain. That""s why it""s called as ""Satyakhand""‚ means you start seeing the truth perceived by your brain because so far whatever you see through your brain‚ is not the truth. What you see‚ is just the outer side‚ say‚ you can see the colors. You can see the different aesthetics of the colors. You can see the quality of the thing. But you cannot say whether this carpet has been used by some saint. You cannot say whether this is made by a devil or a divine person. You cannot say that this gentleman is he a good person or he is an evil person. You cannot say if this Deity has come out of the Mother Earth or not. Also‚ you cannot say about any person who is your relation‚ whether he is a good relation or a bad relation‚ or what sort of a person he is; whether he goes to wrong people or to the right people‚ whether he has connections with wrong side or with good side. Here good means Divine. So actually you do not know anything about divinity with your mind‚ nothing. Nothing – it is impossible for you to judge a person about his divinity unless and until the Kundalini reaches at least this part‚ which is the limbic area. You cannot make out whether a person is real or not‚ whether a guru is real or not. Because divinity cannot be perceived through your brain‚ unless and until this light of your Spirit shines into it.
Now‚ the Spirit is expressed in the heart‚ is reflected in the heart. The center of the Spirit‚ we can say‚ is in the heart. But actually‚ the seat of Spirit is above here [Shri Mataji puts Her right hand above Her Sahasrara]‚ and that is the Spirit‚ what we call of the God Almighty‚ whom you call ""Parvardigar"". You call Him Sadashiva or you can call Him‚ ah‚ the Rahim and you can call Him by many names which are said about the Lord who is God Almighty. Niranjan‚ they call It‚ Nirankar‚ every sort of words which start with Nira‚ Nihi.
Now‚ at every center in the body you""ll receive a different type of joy. Every center has a different type of joy and there are names for every type of joy you receive at every center when the Kundalini rises. But‚ when the Kundalini comes into the Sahasrara‚ then the joy you receive is called as Nirananda‚ Nirananda. Now‚ ""Ni"" means nothing else but Ananda (joy). Nirananda! Also‚ is surprising‚ My name is Nira – also‚ in My family I""m called as Nira. And Nira also means Mary‚ Maria‚ because it means marine. Nira is water. Nira means water in Sanskrit language.

He could become so subtle that nobody could see Him.
There are nine Siddhis that He got. So‚ a person‚ who has got the Right side too much in him‚ He controls him with these nine Siddhis.

He makes his feet very heavy‚ now he can""t do that much. Or He makes his hands very heavy so the person cannot work very much with his hands.

Sitting down here‚ He can put the tail around anywhere. If He wants He can just make a mountain of His tail and sit on that. Like He has all these monkey-tricks as you can call them‚ you see.

13680,Geography of a few selected Swayambhus on Earth ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX63gXeOKqs,,"""Thousands and thousands‚ millions of years back‚ the Mother Earth started producing Her Ganesha. It was first a huge ocean where Himalaya stands. Himalaya gradually started coming out of that ocean‚ in flat way‚ like a Shiva-Lingam‚ which is the expression as the manifestation of the animals; they have the brains which are flat. But when the Himalayas started coming out of the sea‚ the Mother Earth was pushed on the sides. And the Mother Earth started giving folds to Her sari‚ you can say. Now‚ when that movement started‚ the sari gave waves of vibrations in such a way that at certain points it rose up to a point becoming like Shri Ganesha. And it was‚ to begin with‚ of flat‚ again the same type.
But then‚ still more folds started coming up‚ much later‚ when human brain started developing its ego. So the whole of that land was pushed up and another land joined it in such a manner that it formed an apex. The super-ego was pushed in and was brought to the climax. That synchronizes with the human brain‚ because the whole universe is represented in our body as well. Now‚ the central axis of the Mother Earth acted as the spinal cord. By this happening in the Himalayas‚ again there was a big push on to all the mountains which were to be created as Shri Ganesha and they got into their final forms. And the apex was created.
So‚ the Mother Earth as Gauri created all these Ganeshas. At the other end of these ranges‚ must be the highest mountain because it is pushed the most. Mount Blanc should be higher than this. You see‚ when they pushed on the right hand side more the ego went expressing in Mount Blanc‚ you see for example. And on the other side‚ it was created another Ganesha at other end near Darjeeling. So Shri Ganesha was expressed even in Darjeeling‚ and you get the same kind of redness on that. I have seen another Shri Ganesha created in Delphi where they say is the Nabhi of the Mother Earth.
Also when Shri Shiva Lingam is created‚ along with Himalayas‚ there is a Shri Ganesha created‚ as in Amarnath‚ where a drop of water falls on a particular area and creates the lingam. Plus that‚ another drop falls on another side and creates Shri Ganesha exactly like the face. Now the ocean is the father‚ and the Mother Earth is your Mother. But when the Mother Earth becomes a mountain‚ She is called as the Father. The reason is‚ She at that height can catch the Father on top of Her head‚ as snow or as rain.
That is how a mother becomes the father‚ and so She can perform the complete function of a father and a Mother. In that state only Gauri‚ the Daughter of the Mountains‚ conceived Shri Ganesha without the help of the Father‚ immaculate. The purity of snow is a hundred percent‚ and that covers the Mother Earth‚ gives the formation of innocence. All the filth and dirt goes into the ocean is clarified by the sun‚ which is also Shri Ganesha‚ and is brought on the top of the hills and mountains to cover it.",https://www.amruta.org/p/1357,,,,,,,,,,,Ganesha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So this Kundalini‚ when it arrives here (at Agnya level on forehead)‚ the first hurdle the Kundalini has‚ to enter into the Sahasrara‚ is ""Ekadasha Rudra"". These are 11 Shaktis‚ 11 destroying Shaktis placed here. Five on this side five on the other side and one in the centre. These are obstructions within us‚ built by two types of sins we commit. If we bow our heads to wrong type of gurus and submit ourselves to their vicious ways‚ then we develop Rudra – problems on the right hand side- these five go out. If you have bowed- because I""ve never bowed to anybody wrong type of person and who is anti God‚ then the problem comes on this side of the thing‚ on the Right side. If you have‚ the sense that ""I can look after myself‚ I am my own guru‚ who can teach me‚ I don""t want to listen to anybody and I don""t believe in God‚ who is God‚ I just don""t care for God"". All such feelings if you have‚ then your Right side doesn""t catch. But the Left side catches. Because‚ Right side moves this side and the Left side this side. So these ten things and one is Virata-Vishnu‚ because also in the stomach we have got 10 Guru Sthanas(places) and one that of Vishnu. So the seeking is also wrong‚ as well as these 10 Gurus are out. Then you develop this Ekadasha Rudra. When this thing is set–in within you‚ as I""ve said‚ one on this side and one on that side. So those people who have bowed to wrong type of people develop a temperament or a kind of a personality which is very vulnerable for incurable diseases like cancer or any such thing- those who have bowed to wrong types of people.
Now those who think‚ ""I""m better than anybody else. I don""t care for God‚ I don""t want God‚ I have nothing to do""- all such people develop a Left side Ekadasha.

13870,The Science of God,,The essence of Beeja (Seed) Mantra as explained by Shri Mataji," Beeja Mantra means say the ""Vaikhari"". Vaikhari is the power of speaking. This power of speaking is made into mantras by people who have power of Realization. Now‚ so‚ for them to improve‚ supposing they want to improve their centre‚ or they want to improve their left or right. They have to say the Beeja Mantras. If they say the Beeja Mantras‚ that area gets the ""beeja"". Then the ""beeja"" has to sprout and has to grow. So the first step they have is to say the ""beeja mantra"" and they have to say the different mantras of the different Chakras. So‚ one is the ""beeja"" and then is the tree. So if you know the ""beeja"" first of all‚ you can implant a ""beeja"" into yourself by saying that‚ and then you start saying all other. So‚ that""s how you make it grow.
The word ""Sanskrit"" has come out of Kundalini""s movement. When she makes a sound all was recorded by the great saints and like that every Chakra has got vowels and consonants according to the number of sub- plexus they have‚ you can say petals they have and all of them make all the alphabets of Sanskrit language.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/12171,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13880,The Science of God,,Sanskrit is made holy,"""This language was made holy. First it was one language‚ out of which two languages were born. One was Latin and the one which was made holy was Sankrit. The Sanskrit language comes from the saints‚ who heard all those things and they made this and this is the energy of the ""Vaikhari"". Now the script is there‚ the ""Vaikhari"" is there. The energy is there and this is the way you should say the instrument‚ but to make it work in a divine way‚ you have to make it into a mantra. To make it a mantra‚ any mantra you want to do‚ you must know first the ""beeja"" mantra. Supposing‚ you want to raise your Kundalini‚ then the ""beeja"" mantra is ""reem"" and from ""reem"" you should go on to ""Om Twameva‚ Sakshat Shri Reem"". Then you should go on saying the mantras of all the Deities that are there. You all have become ""Vidyawan"" now.
Now you try to understand that how this ""vidya"" has been penetrating into you slowly. Not with any teachers or anybody sitting with a stick in the hand. The whole ""Vidya"" is exposed from within and without. Whatever I say‚ you can tally it on your vibrations. So it goes into your hand. You don""t accept it because I am saying but it is so‚ that""s why you accept it. Supposing I say‚ this is water‚ then what‚ you will drink the water and you will see if it quenches your thirst. Then only you are going to believe that this is water‚ otherwise you are not going to believe. In the same way it is. We are ""Swayama - Siddhas"".
""Ra"" is the energy‚ Radha. The one who sustain the energy is Radha. She is Mahalakshmi that is why She sustains the Kundalini. ""Eee"" is the Primordial Mother‚ and ""Ra"" is the energy that is Kundalini. So the ""Reem"" means that you have the energy passing through‚ towards the Primordial Being. So ""Reem""‚ that is why the Yogis‚ because they believe only in connection. Yogis believe in Yoga and so they have to look after the energy and also the Primordial Mother. This is very important because that is how energy should be there; Kundalini‚ as well as Primordial Mother. Fourteen housands years before‚ they have written all this which is the truth‚ which you know now.

13890,The Science of God,,Knowledge on (Emission of sounds) Para  ...Pashyanti  ... Madhyama‚ Vaikhari and Paravani," ""Paravani"" starts from here. (Shri Mataji explains‚ keeping Her Hand on Her Nabhi). There is the sound‚ which is silent. Then it comes to the heart‚ when it becomes ""anahat""‚ it""s called as ""Pashyanti"" because it just witnesses. The ""Vani""‚ the energy of Vani‚ the energy of that sound just witnesses and is Anahata state. Then it comes here (Vishuddhi level)‚ so it""s called as ""Madhyama""‚ still in the middle stage‚ up to the throat‚ but when it comes to the mouth‚ it becomes ""Vaikhari""‚ means then it speaks‚ speaks. So‚ this is how the Paravani means the Paravani is the - say‚ if God has to say something - then he says it in Paravani‚ which you can""t hear it. So‚ in the same way you have got your Paravanis within you‚ which is of course‚ the human (we should say) reflection of the same Paravani‚ which you can""t hear it. You can""t hear the ""Vani"" in your stomach‚ but say you get some troubles‚ specially cancer or any such diseases‚ you get a problem. That causes ""spandan"" throbbing‚ is vibrations that you get‚ is the effect of that Paravani‚ which shows you that there is some trouble. That trouble you can see‚ then it starts throbbing. Even the Kundalini‚ when She starts‚ She doesn""t make any sound‚ but She comes here (Sahasrara)‚ and if there""s any problem‚ She makes a throbbing. As long as there is obstruction‚ she goes on making throbbing. It""s like a - it""s like a smooth water‚ when it runs‚ it doesn""t make any sound‚ but when there is obstruction‚ it makes a sound. So‚ there is a sound innate. This sound is due to percussion in the water‚ but there is innately sound built into the ""Vani""‚ this sound which is silent sound‚ which rises from these four stages and when it comes to the mouth‚ then only it becomes ""Vaikhari"". In the case of God‚ see‚ when He speaks‚ whatever He is speaking‚ nobody can hear it‚ unless and until you have reached the state of Paravani. Unless and until you have felt your Paravani‚ you cannot hear it.
So what happens‚ that‚ God Himself has to come on this earth and has to use His Vaikhari to explain things to you. So by that you start going down and down. Then you come to madhyama state‚ where you enjoy your silence. Then you come to Pashyanti‚ there you enjoy your witness state and then you come to Paravani‚ where you get the sound or you can say that you get the information‚ just information‚ but it has no sounds‚ no noise‚ nothing‚ just the information like a thought. Thought doesn""t have sound‚ so the inspiration comes to you from Paravani. But thought has no sound. In the same way‚ it is a soundless thing that comes."" Sahaja Yogi - ""Is this in the Void or the Nabhi or some special place?""
Shri Mataji – ""Nabhi. This Lakshmi Tattwa‚ the Mahalakshmi starts‚ with that all these things work out‚ but when you start rising higher to the Agnya‚ then this ""Vani"" goes as ""Anahata"".
""Anahata"" means the sound of the vibrations. I can hear. I mean somebody who puts hands on me‚ can also hear. All kinds of sounds you can hear then it comes up to the head here (Sahasrara). When it reaches‚ then it starts making throbbing‚ then the ""Brahmarandhra"" is opened out‚ the ""Vani"" becomes the sound‚ becomes one with God. But this state‚ up to this state it comes up‚ in a human being normally it comes out from here. It is‚ a part of it‚ from God‚ but when it is given‚ the Agnya is opened out and then when it crosses this Sahasrara‚ then this Vani‚ this sound of vibrations also comes out. Main thing is one has to understand‚ that when you have reached a state of ""Nirvikalpa""‚ then the inspiration comes to you through this ""Vani"" in your brain. This same ""Vani"" gives you inspiration in your brain and that inspiration gets you understand. Like I say you should know something between the lines. So‚ because you have become a subtler sensitive person (Sookshma)‚ so you can also start understanding the ""Sookshma"" and also saying things which are ""Sookshma"".

13970,The Science of God,,Puja is one of the things by which you can excite the forms into formless," Because worshipping any Vigraha‚ any statue of self-created vibrations of Mother Earth‚ people had big problems. They had to first of all do a meditation‚ which was called as Sarvikalpa Samadhi. That means in that state you had to concentrate on such a statue‚ Vigraha. Vigraha means the one‚ which is a vibrating statue‚ and try to raise your Kundalini. And Kundalini used to come up to your Agnya‚ but the jumping beyond the Sahasrara was an impossible task because one has to go from form to formless. And it was so difficult to get out of form to formless‚ and even to concentrate on abstract or formless was another impossible task‚ as the Muslims did‚ or many others tried to do. Under these circumstances it was necessary that the formless had to take a form so that there were no more complications. As soon as you concentrated on the form you became formless. Like you have ice before you‚ as soon as you start touching the ice‚ it melts away and you start feeling the cool.
So the problem is very easily solved now. Puja is one of the things by which you can excite the forms into formless. Now your centres are the centres of energies‚ but they too have a guiding Deity sitting on all these Chakras. They are also the formless made into forms. And when you do the Puja‚ the form melts into formless energies. And these formless energies start flowing‚ and then blows the wind.

Then the Adi Shakti went into three forms and with one form She started all the elements. That Tunkaar (OMKARA) which is auspiciousness‚ which is holiness. The Tunkaar is the one which has spread into the whole atmosphere‚ is the auspiciousness and the holiness. Went with everything that was created‚ but it was created by the Right side. So though it is surrounded by it‚ like this house is made but its surroundings are different. So the surrounding air supposing the Omkara‚ then this house is made. So this is not that the Omkara has made this‚ but it surrounds and because of its surrounding also it moulds‚ it moves‚ because the Chaitanya which is actually the Omkara‚ we should say‚ is all the time guiding‚ penetrating‚ organizing‚ improving everything.""
SahajaYogi-""It is only the Devi that does‚Shri Mataji?""
Shri Mataji - ""She does everything. No doubt about it. She does everything. She is the doer. She first created Ganesha‚ through which auspiciousness is controlled through which holiness is controlled and through which all universe gets surrounded by Her. Then it also enters‚ like supposing I touch anything‚ it becomes holy‚ because the Chaitanya goes into it and it becomes holy‚ it becomes auspicious. So it can pass into it‚ it can pass into anything. But anything dead‚ it doesn""t have Omkara. It has got electro magnetic forces and then electro magnetic goes into higher stage when the nitrogen enters into it‚ then it becomes ""Prana"".
So at different stages it goes‚ then it becomes a human being.Still is a human being till he becomes a Realized Soul‚ then its different story.

14030,The Science of God,,How Param Chaitanya worked within each of us,"  It is like you have to accept a hypothesis that there exists an all pervading power above the human brain. This is the only hypothesis. The human brain is in the form of a pyramid. The Param Chaitanya or the all- pervading power is coming from all sides and striking the brain of a fetus‚ soon after its formation. What actually happens is that‚ at the apex of this pyramidal brain‚ the Param Chaitanya passes unhindered and settles down the spine in the inverted triangular bone area‚ at the base‚ in three and a half coils as the Kundalini Shakti. In the process it leaves its mark called the ""Vacuum Channel"" in the spine. Now the Param Chaitanya hitting the sides of the triangular brain has to permeate the grey and the white matter. These have their own densities‚ and so governed by the physics Laws of Refraction‚ the Chaitanya refracts from left to right and from right to left. This is also called the Prismatic Refraction Effect. This phenomenon exists mostly for human brains and not so much in animals.
During the refraction process‚ the human attention is pulled out to both the sides and is driven in the outward direction. Both the attention and the refracted Chaitanya cross at the Agnya Chakra from both the sides on their way out. As a result of this pull‚ an additional force called the resultant force is created. Now the theory of the Parallelogram of Forces (of Physics) comes into play. The resultant force is divided into two parts‚ each being at a 90-degree angle to the other on both the left as well as the Right side. The resultant force acts in the centre of its two counterparts. One part creates the left and the right sympathetic channel of the fetus by pushing its way down the body. The other part pushes its way out through the senses‚ dragging with it the human attention both to the left and to the right. The second part is also known at the action in the outer world. From the outer world‚ this action brings back a reaction; (another famous law of Physics) the path followed by the action and reaction is the same. On the Left side this reaction builds one""s Conditionings‚ while on the Right side it builds the Ego.
In short‚ our Chitta accompanied by the resultant Brahma‚ Chaitanya""s living force went to the outer world‚ collected a reaction and brought back with it a conditioning from the left‚ thereby forming the Manasa or the mind. Both the action and reaction pass through both the Agnya and the Vishuddhi Chakras. The Chitta‚ being dispersed in nature‚ has the ability to flow from the whole body. The reaction of the left is the desire element‚ the potential of which gives birth to the Ida Nadi on the left Sympathetic Channel. Similarly‚ the reaction of the Right side is the action element‚ the potential of which forms the Pingla Nadi. The overflow of the Ida Nadi forms a balloon like cloud at the back of the Agnya Chakra called the Super Ego; while the overflow of the Pingla Nadi forms a similar cloud in front of the Agnya Chakra called the Ego. The Agnya remains directly in between these two balloons.

Now take a finger and poke the cloth in the center from the bottom and raise it upwards. What happens? The cloth is pulled up to a point and in the process it just wraps or falls around the finger. In the same way‚ when the Kundalini rises‚ it pokes the attention‚ raises it to the Sahasrara‚ where it gets enlightened by the light of the Brahma Chaitanya. It then just wraps and falls in line with the Kundalini""s path on the Sushumna Nadi in the centre. What has actually happened is that on Realization‚ our Chitta is pulled inside from wherever it is spread out in the outer mundane world. The Chitta is thereby enlightened. This is the so-called state. But in reality we humans are slaves of our habits. We out of sheer habit do not allow our Chitta to stay put in that state permanently. Actually the Chitta should not go out. Here is a simple situation that I find Myself to be in with you. I am putting you in the boat to sail off‚ but you are resisting My help by constantly sticking your one foot in the water. Your attention is on the frivolous things you see‚ out of your habit you put out your leg‚ knowing very well‚ I am sitting inside to sail you through. I also happen to see that your leg may be swallowed any time by an alligator. But you‚ in your own habits are blind enough not to notice the alligator. Now can you imagine My plight? Imagine how I feel!
That is why I say - do Satsang - meaning spend time with other Sahaja Yogis with the object to keep your attention in the centre. It is very important to constantly keep your attention in the centre. With the Realization our left and the right Nadis relax upon receipt of Divine energy. Due to the release of the tension‚ the Chakras open out still further. It is a cycle. More Kundalini fibres can then rise and so on. At this stage the attention develops a quality to remain in the centre.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/19699,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14050,The Science of God,,How Shri Adi Shakti created the universe that we live in,"""The whole atmosphere that we know of is very artificial. But when you understand what She has done - the first thing She does is to (in My book also I have written down about it but I would like to tell you) that Her first‚ we should say‚ manifestation‚ is on the left hand side. That is the Mahakali""s manifestation. So She comes on the Mahakali""s system‚ the left hand side‚ and that is where She created Shri Ganesha. Shri Ganesha is created because of His purity‚ His innocence and auspiciousness. This had to be created before She created the Universe. So the first thing She does is to create Shri Ganesha and She settles down. Then She goes up‚ of course in the body of the Virata‚ and there She goes round and goes up on the right hand side in the other way‚ and there She creates all the Universes‚ as you call them ""Bhuwanas""; one universe. There are fourteen Bhuwanas means this many many universes makes one Bhuwana. And She creates all these things on the right hand side. Then She goes up and then She descends down creating all these Chakras - Adi Chakras or the Pithas. She comes down‚ makes all these pithas and then She settles as the Kundalini we can say‚ Kundalini is a part of it. The rest of the work is much more than this. So all the residual energy means after going through all this journey‚ then She comes round and She goes up as Kundalini. Because of this Kundalini and the Chakras‚ She creates an area‚ which we call as Chakras in the body. Now first She creates these Chakras in the head we call them the pithas of the Chakras‚ and then She comes down and creates these Chakras‚ which are in the body of the Virata. Now once this has happened then She creates human being but not directly. Through the evolutionary process‚ She goes through‚ and that is how the evolution starts‚ and then it starts developing from the minute small little microscopic organism in the water and then it starts evolving. So when She creates water and She creates all the universes‚ She chooses this Mother earth as the best place to play Her evolutionary process. And there She makes this little microscopic thing.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/1715,,,,,,,,,,,Ganesha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Qualities,,
14060,The Science of God,,They cannot give you the awakening of the Kundalini becuase My photograph has My desire also in it.,"  there""s a very big difference between a statue and a photograph‚ because My attention is there. Of course‚ even the statues which are created by Mother Earth also have vibrations and they also show they have vibrations‚ but they cannot give you the awakening of the Kundalini because My photograph has My desire also in it. They cannot. If they could‚ Stonehenge would have.
If you go to these statues and if I am there‚ they make no vibrations‚ only you have to put one hand towards Me and the other towards them‚ then they start emitting‚ but they have to accept My permission. Even the statue you have of Ganesha-now it""s all right‚ but in the beginning‚ it never used to give vibrations until it was worked out this way. But they do not lack authority. So the protocol of those photographs is important to start developing that faith. You should keep one photograph with you all the time in your pocket; respect it. As many as possible‚ respect them. Not for decoration‚ but to be respected.
In the morning you see the photograph. Now I""m telling you because of faith problem. I have to tell you it Myself‚ the whole thing. That""s the worst part of this incarnation because other things you have done‚for example‚ those who follow Christ‚ they will have his photograph in the morning. Especially if they""re Hindus‚ they""ll touch the feet morning time‚ evening time‚ before sleeping‚ going out‚ coming in‚ they""ll do that. In the same way‚ when you have a photograph‚ you work on that with that understanding that Mother""s with us.

14070,The Science of God,,Feminine Ghost came as a serpent and told that better you taste the fruit of knowledge   ...," So when this Adam and Eve business started she thought that they will be just like other animals or angels. What is the use? They must know what they are doing; they must know why they are doing. They must have the freedom to understand what is the knowledge and like fixed machine like life‚ that these animals are having‚ why would they have? So in Her arbitrary power which was conceded of course‚ She is the one who came as a serpent and told them that you taste the fruit of knowledge. Now for people who are not Sahaja Yogis you can not tell this. They will be shocked. But‚ this serpent that came for them to test‚ and then to tell them that you better taste this fruit. This serpent told the woman‚ not the man‚ because woman is supposed to accept things easily. He may even accept bhoots‚ he may even accept nonsense but she is the one who accepts; while the man does not accept easily. He argues‚ he discusses‚ that is why She came and told the woman. She came and told woman‚ I should say. This Holy Ghost actually is a feminine and so move nearer to a woman. This feminine Ghost came as a serpent and told that better you taste the fruit of knowledge. Now it was the job of the lady to convince her husband because woman knows how to do that. Some times they may convince them wrongly‚ tell them something which is very wrong‚ very sinister‚ as you know in Macbeth what happened? So many places we have seen‚ women have misguided their husbands. But‚ men can be misguided or could be guided or could be emancipated‚ if they have a proper wife. So he had all faith in his wife‚ believed in it and they tasted the fruit of knowledge under the guidance of this Holy Ghost who was a feminine personality of God. This can not be conceived that the people who are just getting a glimpse of Christ or a glimpse of Mohammad Sahib or glimpse of Nanak Sahib. They cannot understand. They just had a glimpse of them. If they have told the people would have said‚ ""Wah! What is this?"" they would have never listened to them.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/1436,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14080,The Science of God,,He is witnessing the play‚ the game that Holy Ghost is playing,"  Now let""s see who is this God and what am I talking about? In the beginning‚ it was just a Silence‚ complete Silence. And out of the Silence‚ when it awakened‚ the Silence was awakened. The Silence is called the ParaBrahma. I am sorry‚ I have to use Sanskrit language; it does not mean it is something Hindu. These ideas you must get rid of it. India people have meditated much more. They did not have to fight the Nature‚ like we had to fight today‚ while coming to this hall. The atmosphere is so nice and warm there. People could sit and meditate under a tree. They did not have to fight the nature so much. They had a long time to meditate. In their meditation they have found out a lot of things for which they have used Sanskrit language. So‚ this ParaBrahma or you can say‚ the ""Absolute Silence"" was awakened‚ got awakened because it itself got awakened; like we sleep and we get awakened. And then the Silence became what you call Sadashiva. When it was awakened or when this Sadashiva started breaking in the sense that It wanted‚ It desired to create. As we say‚ that the morning sun is breaking through the dawn; in the same way when this desire started manifesting‚ the desire became His power and got separated. Now‚ whatever I say is just a story for you; you need not believe it‚ but I will reach a point which you can believe into and then step by step you can believe into this theory. This is just a hypothesis for you. So‚ use when this desire became a power‚ this power was called Shakti or Maha Shakti or Adi Shakti. Means Primordial Power. This Primordial Power assumed a personality and entity; it had to‚ if it had to act. If you have only a desire in your heart‚ it is no good. We have to transform it into some form‚ otherwise the desire will rise and fall. So‚ this desire got into a form‚ we can say‚ into an entity‚ which we call in the Bible‚ the Holy Ghost and in the Sanskrit language - Adi Shakti. This desire then created out of itself two more powers‚ one to act and the other to improve upon its own creation. So‚ three powers started acting and thus these three powers were created. Now‚ as we know‚ that people have not talked much about the Holy Ghost in the Bible. Many scriptures that have talked about the Father have not been able to talk about the Holy Ghost‚ especially‚ when Christ""s Mother Herself was an incarnation of Holy Ghost. He did not want to endanger Her life. He did not even say She was the incarnation of the Holy Ghost‚ because‚ if they had crucified Her He would have come out with His own destructive powers. But‚ the drama was to be played and She remained a silent person. Now this Holy Ghost is important for us‚ because Father is just a witness. He is witnessing the play‚ the game that Holy Ghost is playing. He is going to enjoy Her creation. He is the only witness of that game and She is trying to please Him by creating this because it was His desire to create. So She created with these forces‚ that we have got‚ which are called‚ the first one‚ the Desire; Mahakali‚ the second one‚ the Action; Mahasaraswati‚ and the third‚ the Sustenance or you can call it the Evolution; Mahalakshmi. These three powers acted to create us human being. Here we have reached this stage‚ when we can talk about this. Even at the time of Christ‚ one could not talk of the Holy Ghost.What could we do with the fishermen? Just tell Me‚ how could you tell them about these things? That was just a preparatory thing but you know‚ what a mess is there‚ and people can""t understand those who call themselves religious. How could they be fanatic? Fanaticism and religion are at dagger""s ends. They can""t be one thing.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/281,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14090,The Science of God,,How our Saraswati tattwa transforms into the Mahasaraswati tattwa," This feeling that you are Hindus‚ Muslims‚ Christians‚ Brahma samajis etc.‚ has no base. You are nothing but a human being‚ you are born a human. You have branded yourself that you are something. You are neither Bengali nor Marathi. You are just a human being. By branding yourself you create more problems. This brand becomes so important that you cannot see anything beyond it. Till this catch does not release‚ this blindness will not go because you see everything in such a way that only your way is right. In the west it is even more so. If you put anything into their brains and tell them that are good‚ then they will follow it blindly. The critics there also criticize every art form so much. Another critic will refute what the first critic has refuted. Nothing comes to you from within yourself and your brain. Whatever others have filled in is accepted. Each is branded. By this the ego rises and a person thinks that he is very great personality and very unique from others. He becomes an individual. The essence of truth is that we are all one‚ are a whole‚ are a totality. When we go in the opposite to it then you become individualistic and go on becoming more and more separate. This is true that one leaf does not resemble another but all of them are on the same tree. They are all a part and parcel of the Virata. When we separate ourselves then the Saraswati tattwa‚ which should become Mahasaraswati tattwa does not.
When you live in the Mahasaraswati tattwa you start seeing in your daily life that you are the whole‚ and we are one. So when an artist creates‚ he makes some such things that one accepts from the heart. All the works that we do of Saraswati should be dedicated and surrendered to the Divine. If this happens then all such works will be immortal. All poems‚ music‚ songs‚ art forms which were offered in the name of God are still living today. Like today""s film music comes and dies down. But the songs of Kabir‚ Gyaneshwara are still remembered. Through their Self Realization they obtained the Mahasaraswati Shakti and whatever they wrote or created‚ that light was of a unique kind. These were creations that united the world into one. One should not only move on Saraswati tattwa as this limits you. One should move on the Mahasaraswati tattwa. If Saraswati tattwa is the seed then the tree is Mahasaraswati. Till you do not make this seed into the Mahasaraswati till then you cannot merge with Mahalakshmi. The gift of Mahalakshmi within you is that you get your Self Realization. All the three‚ Mahalakshmi‚ Mahasaraswati and Mahakali meet at Agnya.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/12311,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14100,The Science of God,,How the Heart goes mental? And how to attain Divinity and Spirituality,"  ...""Another way is that you start seeing the blessings and you start seeing how you feel physically‚ emotionally and spiritually. Still on the mental level most of the people recognize but unless and until it is recognized in the heart it is no recognition. Already the heart is surrounded by seven auras of the seven Chakras and the Spirit (Atma) resides in the heart. As it is on top of your head resides God Almighty Sadashiva. When Kundalini touches that point your Spirit starts spreading and it starts acting on your central nervous system because automatically the vibrations‚ the Chaitanya flow into your brain‚ which enlightens your nerves. But still recognition of the heart is not there. Even without that you start feeling the cool breeze. You can raise Kundalini of others. You can cure people. You can do many things but still it is not recognition because recognition is mental activity of the heart. How can heart have a mental activity? This is another problem you face - i.e.‚ the mental activity of the heart. Say you are a Christian born in a Christian family; as soon as you see the photograph of Christ you feel something in the heart. If you are a Hindu and you see a photograph of Shri Ram‚ immediately it""s recognition in that heart.
But the recognition of somebody living with you is very very difficult and you live on the cusp of your mental activities only. But to go deep down into your heart‚ what should be done? How can the mental activity be performed through the heart you must remember that heart is absolutely connected with the brain? When heat fails the brain also fails. The whole body goes out of order. So this mental activity of the heart is to be understood this way that as soon as you see danger‚ without even thinking‚ in a reflex way your heart starts pumping more blood and you get palpitation. It is a reflex action. This activity takes place because it is built in within you. That as soon as you see emergency your sympathetic nervous system goes into activity and you start feeling the fear‚ the desire to do something about it‚ but you do not think‚ you just run. The fear is built in the central nervous system. Any reaction or response is built in. But the response to the Spirituality is yet not manifested. It will manifest. Through your past you have learnt that you have to be afraid of this or that. With the experience gradually you build in reaction of reflex within you so that you try to save yourself. What experience should you have to build that in your heart? This experience is of your own Divinity and Spirituality. Once you start developing that experience then you know that you are Divine person.
Unless and until you are fully aware that you are a Divine person‚ whatsoever faith you may have in the recognition is not complete because the one who is recognizing me is a blind person.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/192,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14110,The Science of God,,When your Kundalini rises‚ one or two strands out of this come up,"""Now‚ we say that it is pure desire‚ but we do not know what purity means. It means your chaste desire. It means it has no lust‚ greed‚ anything in it. That power is your own Mother and is settled in your triangular bone. She""s your own mother. She knows everything about you. It""s like a tape recorder. She knows everything about you and She is absolutely the knowledge because She""s so pure. And whatever Chakras She touches‚ She also knows what""s wrong with that Chakra beforehand. So She""s quite prepared and She adjusts Herself fully so that you do not get a problem by Her awakening. If any Chakra is constricted‚ She waits and goes on slowly opening that Chakra.
Now‚ this Kundalini is the primordial power which is reflected within you and within you‚ in a human being‚ it is like many strands of energy. So it""s like a rope and these energies are all twisted together to form this Kundalini. In a human being these strands are three into seven; that is twenty-one raised to power of one hundred and eight. But when your Kundalini rises‚ one or two strands out of this come up and pierce the fontanel bone area. Only one or two‚ because‚ it has to pass through the inner most nadi‚ known as Brahma Nadi. It""s all a spiral throughout because Kundalini is a spiral and these nadis are also are like a spiral like this. So the inner most nadi is the Brahma Nadi. The outermost nadi is the Right side and the second innermost is the Ida Nadi.
So‚ through the Brahma Nadi‚ She starts sending those threads. By that‚ they relax the centre. By the relaxation of the centre‚ the sympathetic nervous system also starts relaxing and when it goes to the Agnya Chakra‚ then your eyes start relaxing‚ your pupils start dilating and your eyes can become like Mine‚ very black‚ absolutely relaxed.
So‚ you can easily see in a person how far is the Kundalini. If it has pierced the Agnya‚ then the eyes will be completely dilated and will be shining and then She enters into the Sahasrara.
Now‚ it is absolutely pure light of knowledge‚ love‚ compassion and attention. All these three things are in that energy. We know of many energies‚ like electrical energy. We know of light energy. We know of other energies. But these energies cannot think. They cannot adjust. They cannot work on their own. They are to be handled by us. But this energy‚ itself‚ is the living energy and knows how to handle itself. It thinks. If you see a seed being sprouted‚ you""ll find at the tip of the seed there""s a small little cell which knows how to go around the soft places and then how to encircle the stones and then how to find its way to the source. That cell has got‚ I would say‚ a little Kundalini it‚ the way it moves. But within you a tremendous force of Kundalini exists.
So‚ you have a storehouse of compassion‚ which can be enlightened by the spirit. You have the storehouse of love‚ compassion and knowledge and ocean of forgiveness. When people get Realization‚ they do not understand that they have to now grow. And why they don""t grow‚ because‚ they do not ask for these energies. A person who is a Realized Soul‚ if he says‚ ""I have to have more compassion. My compassion is not all right. My concern about others is not all right. My generosity is not all right. I""m exploiting others. I""m exploiting their love‚"" then this energy starts moving‚ giving you that greater dimension of love and compassion. But if you do not want to be growing in your awareness‚ then She says‚ ""All right. He is a half-baked Sahaja Yogi. Let it be."" She doesn""t supply that energy which is stored within you.

14150,The Science of God,,Swadisthana‚ which moves around the Void," The Right side looks after our intelligence‚ thinking etc. the Left side looks after our emotional side. I will tell you about one Chakra‚ which is Swadisthana‚ which moves around the Void. This is the one‚ which is responsible for producing or manufacturing the aortic plexus‚ that""s only in the physical side. When we think‚ the energy we use in our thinking is used up. We are using our brain all the time. What is replacing it is this centre. You know the brain is made of fat cells. This centre converts the fat of the stomach for the use of the brain and that is how those who think too much go into imbalances. Futuristic people are planning all the time. The poor centre which has to do other jobs like looking after the liver‚ pancreas‚ spleen‚ kidneys‚ intestines‚ so with a right-sided futuristic person the first problem can come is with the liver. In the medical science I don""t think they have much knowledge about the liver. It is a very important organ in the body.
The function of the liver is to absorb all the poison of the body and convert it into heat‚ which passes through the blood stream. When you start thinking too much‚ you neglect your liver and then the poor thing does not know how to do this job. So the whole is saturated in the stomach. The person has heat here‚ then the heat starts passing upwards through the right heart. It creates problem and that problem is called Asthma. Then this heat passes into the throat‚ which creates a kind of a cold where you will sneeze twenty times in the morning. There are two types of liver. One is lethargic liver and the other is overactive liver. I am talking of the overactive liver‚ where a person develops cold‚ sneezing‚ temper‚ anger‚ acidity and tension. Then this heat passes over and can go to the heart at a very young age. Supposing there are boys who are playing tennis or exercise of a vigorous nature and drinking‚ this might affect and can cause a massive heart attack at a very young age. The same heat when it passes to the throat we develop throat trouble‚ hoarseness etc. When it moves down to your pancreas then the poor pancreas is also suffering because it has no energy from the centre. Then a person develops diabetes. Too much of thinking gives diabetes. People who think too much‚ sugar gives diabetes. In Maharashtra people drink tea where sugar is so much that the spoon stands up. Nobody gets diabetes because they are villagers‚ living simple lives‚ not thinking of tomorrow‚ how to do this or that. Only the people lives simple‚ not thinking of tomorrow‚ how to do this or that.

14160,The Science of God,,  ...  ...The brain is the Virata‚ heart is Shiva‚ and the liver is Brahmadeva.," The best part of the organization is‚ which is made‚ that consciousness is vertically placed. Sub-conscious and Supra-conscious sort. Supra-conscious‚ right-hand-side of yours and the Sub-conscious‚ left- hand-side of yours. And in the central the path is left on. This is the Sushumna path. It is the Mahalakshmi""s path. It is the path‚ which leads you to the state of Virata‚ to the state of your brain.
So now‚ the combination of three things work out. The brain is the Virata‚ heart is Shiva‚ and the liver is Brahmadeva. All these three powers are there. But at that time‚ when you are Realized‚ then your brain surrenders to Shiva‚ to the principle of Shiva that is the Spirit. Brain is surrendered‚ surrendered not by force or anything‚ but to absorb the power of the Spirit‚ the brain gets surrendered completely to the Spirit‚ so that the Spirit enlightens the brain. It is the enlightenment of the brain that gives you all this subtle understanding. It is to make your brain understand‚ there are so many blissful happenings‚ people are blessed: once‚ twice‚ thrice - then they are surprised‚ the brain starts thinking. ""How did I get this blessing‚ how did it happen to me‚ how could I get my transformation?"" So slowly- slowly they start trusting their heart‚ means they start trusting their Spirit‚ they start trusting their devotion. And this is how the bhakti is absolutely done without any desire‚ without any asking‚ without any obligation‚ just in oneness. Because the brain joins hands with the heart‚ we can say. Now‚ also the Brahmadeva becomes surrendered. As a result‚ what happens: that your liver is surrendered to your brain. When this happens - when your liver is surrendered to your brain - whatever you do is all enlightened work. Whatever you do: whether you sing‚ whether you""re a government servant‚ whether anything - whatever you do with your brain‚ anything through the Swadhishthana or through the Brahmadeva‚ it is an enlightened work.
As it is the brain which is enlightened‚ which is connected with this All Pervading Power‚ whatever you are doing‚ whatever your ideas are‚ being absolutely enlightened means that you achieve them. Enlightened brain‚ whatever it thinks‚ it is thinking as well as achieving - both together. It""s a thing to be understood that an enlightened person has the power to achieve anything.

14170,The Science of God,,  ... if Ganesha gives us the wisdom then Shri Hanumana gives us the conscience.,"""Now‚ then‚ whatever wherever you see the electromagnetic forces working it is worked through Hanumana""s blessings. He is the one who creates electromagnetic forces. So‚ now we can see that as Ganesha has got the magnetic force in Him‚ He is the magnet‚ He has got the magnetic force. Then we can say the electromagnetic is the one which we call as Hanumana""s force‚ on the material side of it. But from the matter He goes up to the brain. So‚ He rises from Swadhishthana up to the brain. So‚ in the brain also He creates the co-relationships of different sides of our brain. So‚ how much He gives us‚ I mean‚ we can say‚ if Ganesha gives us the wisdom‚ then He gives us the power to think. He protects us also that we should not think of bad things. That is‚ we can say that‚ that if Ganesha gives us the wisdom then Shri Hanumana gives us the conscience.
I hope you understand the difference between the two. Wisdom is where you do not need conscience so much because you are wise: you know what is good‚ what is bad. But conscience is needed in a personality‚ where he is to be controlled and that control comes from Shri Hanumana. It is the conscience in the human being. Now‚ this conscience‚ which is Shri Hanumana‚ is the subtle form of Him‚ which gives us – is in Sanskrit called as Sat-asat-viveka-buddhi‚ means‚ Sat means truth‚ Asat means untruth and Viveka means the discrimination and Buddhi means the intelligence. So‚ intelligence to discriminate between the truth and untruth is given to us by Shri Hanumana.
In the Sahaja Yoga system‚ if we say that Ganesha is the one who gives us‚ He is the Adhyaksha‚ means He is the‚ I call Him as the chancellor of the university. He is the one who goes on giving degree to us‚ ""Now‚ you have crossed this Chakra‚ that Chakra‚ that Chakra."" And He helps us to know that what state we are in. So‚ the Ganesha gives us‚ say‚ Nirvichara Samadhi‚ which we can call it as the thoughtless awareness‚ and Nirvikalpa Samadhi. He gives all that and also He gives us joy.
But the understanding that ""this is good‚ this is for our benevolence""‚ - mental understanding - comes to us from Shri Hanumana. And it""s very important for western people‚ because it has to be mental otherwise they won""t understand. If it is not mental they cannot come into abstract‚ it has to be mental.

14200,The Science of God,,What Is Tension?," In these modern times we have something called tensions. It was never there before. People never talked of any tensions. Now everybody says‚ ""I am in tension‚ you give me a tension"". What is this tension? This is because of My Advent. The limbic area wants to know about Me. As Sahaja Yoga is expanding the Kundalini is trying to rise in other people because you people have become the channels. Wherever you go you generate vibrations‚ and these vibrations give a challenge to the Kundalini or a message in various people and it rises. It may not rise up to the Sahasrara or may rise and fall back due to lack of recognition. So every time they do something the Kundalini comes up and gives them a pressure because their Sahasrara is not open. It is a closed door. Because of the closed door it gives them a kind of pressure in the head‚ which they don""t understand and they call it a tension. Actually the Kundalini is trying to push out itself but it cannot. Those who get their Realization but do not make the Sahasrara alright‚ face the same tensions.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/291,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14210,The Science of God,,When your Spirit comes into your brain‚ then you become the fifth dimension,"""Shiva represents the Spirit and the Spirit is residing in all of you in your hearts. The seat of Sadashiva is on top of your head; but is reflected in your heart. Now your brain is the Vitthala. So to bring Spirit to your brain means enlightenment of your brain. ""Enlightenment of your brain"" means‚ the limited capacity of your brain has to become unlimited in its capacity to realize God. I will not use the word ""understand""; to ""realize"" God. How powerful He is‚ how miraculous He is‚ how great He is. Another is the brain of man can create‚ of course out of the dead‚ but‚ when the Spirit comes into the brain‚ then you create living things‚ living works of Kundalini. Even the dead start behaving like living‚ because ""you touch the Spirit in the dead"".
Like the nucleus inside every atom or a molecule‚ has the Spirit of that molecule. And if you become your Spirit‚ we can say the ""brain"" of a molecule and an atom is like the nucleus; body of the nucleus. But the one that controls the nucleus is the Spirit that resides within the nucleus.
So now you have got the attention or the body‚ the whole body of the atom‚ then the nucleus‚ and inside the nucleus is the Spirit.
In the same way‚ we have this body‚ the attention of the body. And then we have the nucleus that is the brain. And the Spirit is in the heart. So the brain is controlled through the Spirit. How? That around the heart there are seven auras‚ which can be multiplied into any number. Seven raised to power sixteen thousand‚ which are the ones which watch the seven Charkas‚ raised to the power sixteen thousand.
Now the Spirit is watching through this aura; watching. I am again saying ""watching"" through this aura. This aura is watching the behaviour of your seven centres in your brain; is also watching all the nerves that are working the brain. ""Watching""; again. But when you bring the Spirit into your brain‚ then you go ""two"" steps ahead. Because when your Kundalini rises‚ She touches the Sadashiva and Sadashiva informs the Spirit. Informs in the sense‚ reflects in the Spirit. So that""s the first state where the watching auras start communicating to your different Charkas in the brain and integrating it.
But when you bring your ""Spirit"" to your brain‚ this the second state‚ then you really become Self Realized‚ in the full way. In the full way. Because then your Self‚ that is the Spirit becomes your brain. Action is very dynamic. It opens then‚ the fifth dimension in the human being.
First when you become Realized‚ collectively conscious‚ and start raising the Kundalini‚ you cross the fourth dimension. But when your Spirit comes into your brain‚ then you become the fifth dimension‚ means‚ you become the Doer. Our brain‚ now‚ for example says ""Alright‚ lift this thing up"". So you touch it with your hand‚ you lift it up. You are the Doer. But when the brain ""becomes"" the Spirit‚ the Spirit is the Doer.
And when Spirit is the Doer‚ then you become a complete Shiva; Self Realized. In that state‚ if you get angry‚ you are not attached. You are not attached person to anything whatsoever. If you possess anything‚ you are not attached. You cannot attach‚ because Spirit is detachment. Complete detachment. You don""t bother about any attachment whatsoever. Even for a second‚ you are not attached.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/1905,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

14230,The Science of God,,  ...supraconscious business is very dangerous‚ no doubt‚ but also the subconscious is very dangerous,"""So this is the movement not crossing the Agnya but moving‚ floating on the left or the right‚ whether you go to subconscious or to the supra conscious. Effects may be different but is the same thing to Sahaja Yoga. The people who go to the supraconscious area may start seeing Me also in different forms like the people who take LSD they can not see Me. And they just see lights coming out of Me. And those who go to the subconscious area they start seeing forms and things in such a manner that they think‚ they have reached heavens. But they are seeing past of evolution‚ past of everything. So this supraconscious business is very dangerous‚ no doubt‚ but also the subconscious is very dangerous. Because all incurable diseases like cancer‚ malaitis‚ all that comes from the movement of the attention to the Left side. So‚ one should be very careful before going to any of these tantriksas. Or to these people who are trying to control you or trying to tell you something about the future or the past.
There is no need to know about the future or the past. What is the need? How does it help? Actually if I start telling you how I came all the way from there and how I was held by the jam or anything‚ will you be interested? How do you get interested in your past glory or past life‚ which was of no value at all today? But it is human weakness that he wants to add to his personality something that is extremely artificial‚ non existent‚ and of no value. And then he says that I did this‚ I did this‚ I happened to do this‚ I never got it.
In India people normally go more to the Left side with this Agnya. Because they say‚ worship God. Now if they have to worship God‚ they have no connection with God. See I had no connection to microphone; I could not speak to you. So without connection to God they start worshipping God. Then they will sing all kinds of Artis‚ fasting‚ this‚ torturing their own lives. This is Left sided people. And singing the praise‚ all these things. Going to the extremes‚ 24 hours they are like that. So some body sucks them to the Left side‚ if they go on saying Rama Rama‚ Rama  ... like that. You might say that Valmiki was told to say. But who told him? It was Narada. Narada was an incarnation‚ Narada. You are not Narada. So how can you tell yourself or any body tell you take this name? You take any name‚ you cannot go to God. So where do you go? You go somewhere. There may be a servant called Rama‚ he might capture you. And people start behaving in such a funny manner that they look like mad‚ insipid people.
Same thing about supraconscious! People who are very ambitious‚ they too can get into a mad condition where they do not think of the collectivity of the whole‚ but they just start thinking about themselves. And when such a situation comes in‚ it is impossible to convince them that they are wrong till they reach their waterloo and finish off.",https://www.amruta.org/p/563,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14240,The Science of God,,  ...to see auras is not a good sign in SahajaYoga," You might get colours‚ you may see the auras and one has to understand here that these auras start coming to us because we shift‚ we disintegrate from our being. That""s how we start seeing something else separated from us. To see auras is not a good sign in Sahaja Yoga. If you are seeing auras‚ we have to bring you back to the same position because you have to be in the present and not in the future. You get disintegrated. For example if there is machine‚ say which takes the aura‚ auras‚ I was talking to someone who has done that work of aura picturing. Now after Realization you don""t get any auras in a person‚ can""t see aura in a person because he is integrated‚ completely integrated. But when he is in a mess‚ he starts getting the auras. Like‚ if he has cancer he will get auras. If he is alcoholic he will get auras. A kind of crazy auras. A normal person may have auras‚ not so much crazy‚ but auras you cannot see‚ when the whole thing is integrated. You can see in a light which has no aberration that means it is good light. If there is aberration then it is a bad light. All the seven colours‚ colours of the light‚ have to be concentrated and have to be integrated. If they are prismatic and if they are giving it separately‚ then it is not one integration‚ and when it is one integration then you cannot see seven lights. So the person is not integrated.
Now all the auras come to us because we are made of seven types of tattwas within us. But the people who are on the Right side only believe in the five tattwas. They call them Koshas. I don""t think I have a type for that‚ but these are the Koshas that are created by the first centre‚ by the second centre‚ by the third centre. These are the physical words‚ by the fourth one‚ then the fifth one and the sixth and the seventh and they do not create auras outside. They create inside near the heart. And these are created near the heart but as soon as you get Realization‚ they all become one. They all merge into one and that is the Spirit. So as if you can say‚ when the Spirit exist in a prismatic way‚ then you get the auras of seven‚ but when it becomes integrated then you become one. So integration is the aim of Sahaja Yoga as now I think I have told you that you could also go to the subconscious area‚ in the same way. The subconscious area is there on the left hand side. If you move into collective subconscious area‚ you can be triggered into cancer. By this triggering you might get heart attack‚ something like that‚ diabetes.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/6745,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That""s how the Shiva becomes ferocious and killed the demons‚ because that energy goes into Him. She didn""t come with any male power Herself and say‚ if you conquer something or you do something good‚ you get a badge or something like that. You might be garlanded with a medal.

If there is no death‚ imagine if all the people who were born since long would have been living today‚ we would not have been here. It would have been so difficult to manage ourselves with all these people.
But so many animals have died and those animals also have become human beings. So many human beings have to die to get other people to come on this Earth and that you have to take some rest and come back again. So the death is just a change of life. Without death life cannot exist. It""s a balance between the two.
So a Sahaja Yogi should never be afraid of death. He should never be afraid of death because if he""s going to die‚ it is only going to be another life where he rests for a while and comes back with greater enthusiasm‚ with greater energy. So there is a complete balance in nature. If you see‚ if there was no balance we could not have existed. Supposing the Earth was moving with a greater speed‚ you would not have existed. If the Pacific Ocean was deeper even by certain feet‚ you would not have existed. So many things are completely in balance. The distance with the sun‚ the distance with the moon‚ everything is so much in balance. If this balance breaks then we would be nowhere.

14380,The Science of God,,Kundalini has three and a half coils," Like you see there is a circle‚ it has a diameter. Between‚ its diameter and its circumference (paridhi)‚ there is a ratio that it makes‚ there is a proportion that you have not established or created. God has established its rule in such a way that it will neither be greater nor lesser than the value. It will have what it must have. That ratio is fixed and can never change. That has not been established or created by you. All the rules that are framed are established‚ created‚ by God. Many of you have asked Me that ""Mataji‚ why do You speak of three and half coils (Kundal)? Why do You say Kundalini has three and a half coils (Kundal)?"" It is absolutely scientific. Whoever understands‚ can understand the fact.
Have you ever tried to observe a wrist watch keenly? In a watch if you observe a circle that has a diameter and its circumference. Now the expression that it makes is like this that if the former is seven then the later has to become twenty-two. It can neither be greater nor lesser than that. If this is seven then the other becomes twenty-two. It will always maintain a relationship between seven and twenty-two and this relationship is expressed by a term known as a ""coefficient""; thus how a ""pie"" is established. This is science. It can never become eight instead of seven and even if it becomes eight‚ then also it will maintain its proportion accordingly. It always will maintain its unique proportion.
Now why should it remain seven only? It is because‚ when the diameter passes through the centre‚ through the mid point‚ then it has to become seven.
Similarly‚ when the Sushumna passes through (within) us it has also to become seven. It has also created seven Chakras in that. And  ...why should it have to become only three and half in that? It is because‚ if you divide the diameter by half‚ then it becomes three and half. Now‚ if you make a sprial wrapping of three and half curves (valay) with respect to the ratio of its ""Pie If you wrap three and half spiral curves (Valay) one above the other  ...one above the other  ...like the coiling of Kundalini and then pierce it with a line traversing through the middle it gets fragmented proportionally into seven equal parts with respect to it but it will make three and a half spiral curves (valay). Similarly‚ when you make a wrapping of the three and a half curves in spiral form one above the other in this manner and pierce through the middle of it (through the mid point) and then make an exit through the central hole‚ it will intersect at seven points (places) within it. That is the reason why we have seven Chakras within us.
But‚ circumference has a different aspect of calculation. If you divide twenty-two by a half you get eleven. But‚ see how much mathematics is involved in everything. You will find that whatever travels or traverses within the centre is expressed in terms of seven while‚ it""s Prakash (the periphery‚ circumference or the halo) while it travels expressions are found in terms of eleven. That is why it is seen while making a donation (to someone at our place); you try to make payment in terms of eleven. Now you must have understood the importance of eleven as a number. Whatever is depicted in our ancient scripture is eternal–Anadi. Those can not be understood even by great mathematical wizards because the ancient saints wrote whatever they contemplated through their research works.

14440,The Divine Declaration,,How it was decided  ...,"""I have to tell you the story about the Sahasrara day‚ about which it was decided‚ long time back‚ before I incarnated. They had a big meeting in the heavens‚ all the thirty-five crore of Gods‚ the Deities were there present to decide what is to be done. This is the ultimate that we have to do to human beings‚ to open their Sahasrara‚ to open their awareness to the spirit‚ to the real knowledge of the divine‚ to remove the darkness of ignorance‚ and it had to be spontaneous because it has to work the living force of God. Also it had to be very quick‚ so all the Gods requested that now I‚ the Adi Shakti‚ had to take birth.
They all tried their best. They did whatever was possible. The saints were made by them‚ but very few. They incarnated and people made religions out of them which were perverted and brought them a bad name. No reality in those religions. These religions were money oriented and power oriented. There was no divine force working‚ actually it was all anti-divine. How to now turn human beings away from these superficial religions‚ these perverted paths of destruction? How to tell them about all these established organizations‚ for ages they have been ruling‚ making money‚ making power.
It was a tremendous task. It had to be done with great patience and love. It was very delicate work also‚ because they believed in those religions‚ innocent people‚ simple people. To blast them that this is all nonsense‚ they are not religions; they are against incarnations‚ against all the prophets‚ against all the saints. That""s why all the real saints had to suffer. It""s a powerful work that was to be done‚ and that""s why Adi Shakti had to take birth on this earth. It had to be before the sixth of May as it was the doomsday of that year. It was done on the fifth of May in the nick of time.
It was all decided beforehand‚ and every Deity""s job was allotted to all of them. Very efficient Deities‚ very obedient‚ they knew Me very well‚ every end of My hair they knew. I didn""t have to teach them protocol‚ love itself gives you protocol‚ but love that is divine‚ not selfish love. It""s not the way we love my child‚ my husband‚ my country‚ my clothes‚ it is the love which is divine‚ which spreads from your heart‚ from your spirit‚ like the light of knowledge. What a tremendous task it is. So I said at Sahasrara I had to be Mahamaya. I had to be Mahamaya. I had to be something that people cannot recognise Me easily. But Deities know. This Mahamaya had to come on this earth‚ not the Adi Shakti in Her purest form‚ it""s too much. So She was covered with this Mahamaya.""

The happening was so tremendous and so unexpected that I was stunned and got totally silent at the grandeur.
I saw the primordial Kundalini rising like a big furnace‚ and the furnace was very silent but burning appearance it had‚ as if you heat up a metal and it has many colours.
In the same way‚ the Kundalini showed up as a furnace like a tunnel‚ as you see these plants you have for coal burning‚ that create electricity‚ and it stretched like a telescope and came out one after another; shoot‚ shoot‚ shoot‚ just like that.
And the Deities came and sat on their seat‚ golden seats‚ and then lifted the whole of the head like a big dome and opened it‚ and then this torrential rain completely drenched Me.
I started seeing all that and got lost in the joy. It was like an artist seeing his own creation‚ and I felt the joy of the great fulfillment.

14510,What the Ancient Scriptures Say,,The difference between a Realized Soul and a non-Realized Soul,"   ...you have to stand on your own legs and know that you are here one with the Truth‚ the testimony of Truth‚ that you have seen the Truth. You know what Truth is and you cannot compromise with falsehood. You just cannot. For that you need not harm anyone. You have to just profess it. You have to stand up and say that you have seen the Truth and this is the Truth‚ and you have to be one with it so that people see that light of Truth in you and they accept it.
It is not for telling others that you have to be truthful and this is the Truth we have seen and this is what God""s Laws are‚ how they work out. Through vibratory awareness we have been able to see that this is the Truth. But be completely confident about it. But for that first of all you must test yourself completely‚ otherwise you might be playing into the hands of evil. It happens with many people who start doing Sahaja Yoga in the beginning. So be cautious. Be sure that you are telling the Truth and nothing else and that you have felt the Truth in full ways. Those who have not felt the vibrations‚ should not talk of Sahaja Yoga. They have no authority. They have to receive vibrations. They have to fully imbibe within them and then they can say‚ ""Yes‚ we felt"".This is very important task Sahaja Yogis have to do in these modern times – i.e. to tell aloud that they have found the Truth. That part is very weak.
In whatever way you like you can announce the Truth. You can write books‚ you can talk to your friends‚ relations and everyone and tell them‚ ""this is the Truth now‚ that you have entered in the kingdom of God. That you have been blessed by the Grace of God. That you are Realized Souls‚ that you have felt the Divine power which is prevailing everywhere. That you can give Realization to others."" This you have to tell others and know that by your accepting the truth‚ you are not adding anything to the Truth but you are adoring yourself.
One requires courage to enjoy the Truth. Sometimes people may mock at you‚ laugh at you and persecute also but that should not be any worry to you because your relationship is with the Statutes‚ with the Grace of God. When that is your connection‚ you should not worry about other people and what they have to say about it. You have to stand up‚ adorn yourself with that Truth and talk to people and people will know that you found it. With that authenticity with which you speak people will know that you have found it.
The difference between a Realized Soul and a non-Realized Soul is basically this: He does not talk of woes and his separation with God. He says ""I have found it now. This is it"""". Like Christ said‚ """"I am the light‚ I am the path"""".
Or anybody else can say that but you can make out that it is not Truth. With the confidence‚ with that complete understanding‚ coming out of your heart people can make out‚ ""this is absolute Truth"" and then all kinds of falsehood must be denounced. Doesn""t matter if somebody feels bad‚ because by telling that you are saving them and not harming them. But must be told in a correct way‚ not in frivolous way. In a very persuasive way‚ you must tell them that this is wrong. You must wait for the time when you can tell people‚ more in confidence. Tell them‚ ""this is wrong‚ it is wrong‚ you don""t know. We have done the same thing"""".
This is how you are going to express your principle of Mastery or you can say """"Guru Tatwa"""". You have to be truthful. First and foremost thing is that you should know the truth and stand the testimony and that you should announce it"".",https://www.amruta.org/p/145,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14520,What the Ancient Scriptures Say,,Shri Mataji enlightens us on the Pasayadan and Gyaneshwari:," But I have seen people who can give lectures on Gita hours together but their brains are closed completely. Now‚ to say that He didn""t say anything about Kundalini is there. That""s why Gyaneshwara in the twelfth century took permission from his brother who was his guru that ""Allow me‚ at least‚ to say about Kundalini"". And that is how it was exposed a little bit. Of course‚ before that also‚ we have had people like Adi Shankaracharya‚ the sixth century‚ and before that also Markandeya; but they talked about the Kundalini‚ that""s all‚ praised the Kundalini. But that She passes through six centers‚ how will It rise and all that. And not about the future‚ that this will happen one day. So many have written‚ of course. But I would say that precisely the one who has written complete description of Sahaja Yogis even‚ is by Gyaneshwara in the poetry called Pasaydan in which he exactly said what will happen‚ how many people will get Realization and he said that ""You the people‚ who are the forests of the trees‚ boon-giving trees‚ Kalpataru‚ boon-giving trees‚ you rise and give it to others"". Then he says that ""You are the oceans who are giving ambrosia talks."" He has described you in such a beautiful manner that you should read the translation of Pasaydan and then you will know what you are‚ how you have been praised by him. And he said that you will lose other relationship and the only relationships will be these. They will be your real relations. To say all these things‚ to have such a vision‚ he must be a great incarnation himself. So‚ this is how in Gyaneshwari‚ which is a commentary of Gita‚ he has put in the sixth chapter‚ now is a commentary on Gita‚ but in the sixth chapter he said how you can get your Realization. About Kundalini‚ how it will work out. So‚ gradually it was all unfolded. And gradually people also developed their spiritual state to understand.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/6418,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

See‚ the water in the glass is reflecting the light. England is the light and the light has to shine out of Italy which is the water. I mean the five elements in a way.
Shri Mataji:
And Spirit can move out of Soul. That""s why the Romans went all the way to England. This is the reason‚ in that seeking. (Referring to the food being served) What is this supposed to be?
SahajaYogi1:
So in a certain sense the Soul is the support of the Spirit?
Shri Mataji:
No‚ no! Soul   ...Yes‚ of course. And both put together is the Soul actually. The Spirit and the causal put together is the Soul. You see‚ like a mirror and its reflection on it. Both put together is the Soul. The causal of the five elements and the Spirit put together make the Soul. Now the vibrations that we feel are the reflection of the light of the Spirit.

What will happen when you leave England‚ Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji:
Then the Soul will be formed; before I go. Atma is eternal; it doesn""t die. But what is happening is‚ by that time‚ the work will be complete; a sort of Realization will take place. Only thing is to raise the Kundalini and that is in India. So I""ll have to go to India.

To raise the Kundalini first‚ then go to Sahasrara. So that work I""ll have to do the stage work there‚ in India.

I could come. I represent England now‚ in this case.
SahajaYogi1:
(Having added his own interpretation to a translation he had made‚ he now addresses Shri Mataji)
I was saying that you come here as the spirit so that your manifestation‚ through that acceptance here‚ gets reflected through vibrations in the whole place.
Shri Mataji:
I mean‚ it helps even the heart. Heart will not reflect so much but your reflection will be received by the heart. The communication from the heart; I am establishing the communication. And a sort of message has been sent from the heart. We get all our information from the heart. We get all the programmes‚ this‚ that‚ from the heart; which is not so efficient but it comes from there. The heart is not very efficient but it is done. All that is like that; it""s systematic and symbolic. SahajaYogi3:
Also you say we have to achieve the deep quality of the Spirit?
Shri Mataji:
Yes‚ you should be able to reflect your spirit. Unless and until you are clean you cannot reflect. So still there are many Sahaja Yogis‚ still are very caught up in Italy. They must correct themselves. Now‚ you see those people who are negative will always sit next to each other; always make friends with negative; will be more friendly with a negative. And that""s how‚ even if they are improving‚ they go down. They are improving a little bit‚ then they go down. Negativity will always join negative; have accidents; have problems; have this‚ have that; children will be sick. (Referring to the meal) How many courses are there?
Sahaja Yogi 1:
So Shri Mataji‚ this is also why there was this wonderful Ganesha Puja here one year ago: because for the causal elements to reflect the Spirit they need to gain the essence of the elements which is Shri Ganesha   ...or I mean the essence of matter.

iii)What are the don""ts and do of Sahaja Yoga?
Answer: ""Very good question. First question is about what are these Vibrations? I told you yesterday‚ that in our heart‚ there is a flicker of light‚ which is burning all the time; which is Atma; which is the reflection of Paramatma in our heart. In short I will tell you. What happens when the Kundalini rises She opens the Brahmarandhra and there is the seat of the Sadashiva‚ the Pitha. The Pitha is here at Sahasrara‚ but Sadashiva is in the Heart‚ reflected as Atma. Pitha is created because it receives the subtle energy which is All Pervading‚ the Gross‚ inside the All Pervading. E.g. this mike collects my voice. Voice is a subtle energy‚ which is collected through this‚ and if you have a radio it will catch them.
In the same way Pithas are in the brain‚ and Pitha of Sadashiva is higher up here‚ which is opened out‚ so that the Subtle‚ the Sukshma‚ the gross passes into our heart‚ through a very Subtle channel. Just like a gaslight‚ it has a flicker. And when the gas opens out the Prakash occurs. Now the Vibrations are that Prakash going through us. These Vibrations start flowing through us. Now what do I do? You will say ""Mataji what do You do?"" I do nothing but I just try to give you that force‚ which is the‚ you can say‚ gas power. That is the gas power. Because the Kundalini knows when I am before you. She rises‚ She opens out‚ and It starts flowing. It is flowing through Me through out. But unless you are subtle‚ you cannot feel it. You can say‚ that I am the Finite in the infinite. Or you can say the Infinite in the finite. I am both. So the energy that is emitted into all the subtle energy is passing through Me. Is the Virat. From the Virata‚ the whole thing is passing. It is going into the All Pervading. It is all Pervading. Everybody‚ everywhere it is going. Even it is in a cell‚ in a Carbon atom it is there‚ in all atoms it is there. It is the Subtle Energy. That is emitted through Me. When you become subtle‚ you become like a radio‚ you start receiving it. Now how will you know what is correct and what is incorrect? You ask the subtle‚ and the subtle answers you‚ and you get the answers on your hand. It is like this. So these are the Vibrations‚ which you receive‚ from the All Pervading power. And the All Pervading Power is emitted out‚ and you receive it from Me of the All-Pervading. It is just the same‚ from everywhere. These are the Vibrations.
The Self Realization‚ which is the very subtle point‚ you try to understand now. That it is so far an unconscious for you. Your Atma is in the unconscious it is not in the Awareness. It is in the Achetan. It is in your unconscious. You are not yet aware about it. But once you are Realized‚ it starts flowing into your awareness‚ means that you start feeling into your Central Nervous System‚ because your nervous system is your Chetana; is your awareness. Human awareness is nothing else but the Central Nervous System. But this Central Nervous System starts feeling now‚ the Vibrations‚ the Light of the Atma through it‚ so that it tells us why it is known as Samadhi. Samadhi means the Unconscious. When the Unconscious becomes the Conscious it is called the Samadhi.
It is not Besudhavstha! It means that you become aware of the unconscious. Not only that‚ but first you become Nirvichara‚ then Nirvikalpa‚ and then a complete Self Realization. So Samadhi‚ is a confusing word Samadhi; just means a Universal Unconscious. Yesterday Justice Vaidya told you that there are three types of Sadhanas‚ Satvik‚ Rajasik‚ and Tamasik. Tamasik goes to the left hand side‚ leads it to the Subconscious‚ collective Subconscious‚ connected to the Libido on the left hand side. The Right side is the Supra Conscious‚ connected to the Pingala Nadi‚ which is the will-power as you call it‚ goes to the collective Supra Conscious. God‚ Goddesses and Ganas are on this side (left)‚ and all those who fall into that go to the hell.
But the centre is the Super-Conscious. For the Sushumna‚ the human being rises above the Super-Conscious. They gradually start becoming more and more aware. They have the same body. For example‚ if you look at the cell of the brain‚ is the same as the cell of a fat. But there is a difference. So the difference starts taking and by the time you open out from here‚ then there is even a greater dimension‚ to that cell. Your brain that it starts receiving the vibrations and can understand it; then in your Nirvikalpa stage‚ you get another dimension‚ by which you have the knowledge. (Words missing here)   ... abouts of your knowledge. The last is the Self Realization‚ where you just enjoy. Complete enjoyment. No problems. You do not catch‚ nothing happens. I would say our Vaidya Saheb is very much near Self Realization. The way he got his Self Realization is very remarkable. The next question is about the vibrations being physiological? Physiologically‚ you can feel on your hands‚ on your fingers. Scientifically you can say that the Parasympathetic gets activated. You get the control of the Parasympathetic; you jump into the Unconscious‚ the Universal Unconscious. I have already told you the spiritual aspects of these vibrations.
Regarding the second part of the question‚ where these vibrations are coming from‚ You‚ cosmos‚ or atmosphere? The vibrations come from everywhere. I am the emitting force‚ all right‚ accepted. This the vital force of life. It gives you a complete balance. It corrects your physical being. It corrects your mental being. It corrects your emotional being. It gives you a complete Spiritual oneness with God. It integrates you completely.
As far as I am concerned‚ I have no Pashchatap. I don""t understand what is Pashchatap. I don""t understand what is temptation. I don""t understand these things because I am completely One with Myself. Every finger I move‚ every hand I move‚ it has a meaning. It is done without thinking‚ but there is a big thought behind it. I say ""Han"". Han means there is a formation of circle which works. It is difficult to explain‚ as my mechanism is different from yours‚ so I can""t explain what I do. You don""t have those mechanics within you. But it is like that. When I say‚ Hin! Hun‚ Han‚ Hin‚ all these are tremendous words. They create a kind of a force; a kind of a formation in which it gulfs all the bad things‚ all the Rakshasas‚ and all that‚ and you can pull them out also. Now I gave in a Mataka‚ my breath. It is a Pranava itself complete. That Pranava‚ in the night‚ when they will be sleeping will come out‚ and take out all the bad things in you gradually‚ and bind them‚ and put them inside. You have seen many mad people are cured like that. ",https://www.amruta.org/p/4544,,Nirvikalpa Samadhi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14570,Seeking Divine Knowledge,,"Question: What are the Don""ts and Do""s for Sahaja Yogis?","Answer: First and foremost thing is that a Sahaja Yogi cannot smoke or drink. One absolutely hundred percent sure‚ because if you drink or smoke‚ you will find after sometime‚ either you will lose your vibrations‚ or you will start vomiting. You cannot smoke. If you smoke‚ your Vishuddhi will be caught. If you drink‚ your Manipur (Nabhi) will be caught‚ and whenever you put your hand towards My photograph‚ your Nabhi Chakra will be burning. Many people have done it without any difficulty. They do not have any difficulty‚ they just give up. So this is one of the most important thing that you have to gradually give up. You just take My name and it will work it out.
Secondly‚ don""t fast. When Mother is there you have not to fast. Only fast on Narak Chaturdashi that""s all. If you don""t feel like eating‚ eat something else‚ but don""t keep your stomach empty. You can drink fruit juice‚ or milk or whatever you like. These are certain things about the food and stomach‚ Nabhi Chakra.
Next the eyes‚ are the very important things‚ where you have to be very careful not to move your eyes very fast anywhere‚ try to keep your eyes steady‚ and mostly on the Mother Earth. You have heard about Lakshmana‚ he never saw the face of Sitaji. Only saw Her feet. How can that be? He was always with them. So you can imagine what should be the position. For complete fourteen years‚ he has to lead a Bramhachari life. She was like his Mother. He knew that She was Adi Shakti‚ but he just saw Her feet. That should be our case. We should lead a sanctified married life. Create a nest of family; a proper family house. Try to adopt‚ compromise‚ adjust. Make your wife Realized‚ make your husband Realized‚ and bring peace in the family‚ because there are many great Souls who want to take birth. Those who got married like this‚ they all got Realized children. So you must try to get a family life‚ a proper family‚ a proper relationship; give service to your parents‚ don""t find faults with your parents and try to be kind to them‚ and try to be good in the family. Don""t spoil the children‚ also correct them. Make them loving. Make a nice society. Every one of you should be the carrier of Love of your Mother. If you are a Sahaja Yogi‚ and if you change and transform in your behaviour‚ naturally Sahaja Yoga will have its own reputation‚ and everybody will start taking to Sahaja Yoga. You cannot earn any money from Sahaja Yoga.",https://www.amruta.org/p/4544,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14580,Seeking Divine Knowledge,,Do not have Sahaja Yogis for business partnership. Do not use Sahaja Yoga for making money. You have to be generous people. You have to be honest.,"There are Ten Commandments as they say‚ and be satisfied in your heart.
You have to lead a chaste life‚ and see chaste things. Your priorities will change. Your friends will change; you will not like dirty jokes. You will just change‚ and run away from them. I have seen these foreigners now. They say that they just cannot tolerate those things now. Once upon a time whatever they used to tolerate and enjoy also; they cannot tolerate it now‚ because you have become sensitive now. You have to be decent people.
Don""t be misers at all. All miserly people are against Sahaja Yoga‚ and if miserly people come I give them troubles. If you are miserly‚ you get lots of troubles. So don""t get miserly. I am telling you‚ don""t be too talkative also. If you become too talkative‚ and troublesome‚ I can stop your talking.
If you don""t talk at all; that is also not good. That means don""t go to extremes.",https://www.amruta.org/p/4544,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14590,Seeking Divine Knowledge,,"Question: What is ""bath""? How to take it?","Answer: It is a simple method. You put My photograph in a proper place. Put a light before it. Even a candle will do. Put both the hands towards the photograph. Sit in the water‚ with a little salt. The water should be a little warm. You will be amazed that the whole trouble will go away in the water. Then you throw away the water in the W.C. Everybody can do it. Now if you have trouble at Vishuddhi Chakra‚ put your right hand towards the photograph first and take out the left hand. Supposing you find the vibrations are flowing into it‚ then you put left hand towards the photograph‚ and the right hand outside. You will be surprised that the whole thing will be cleared out. And if you keep your eyes open towards the photograph and keep your hands like this‚ stretched and with open palms‚ or sometimes towards the Akasha‚ you will be surprised that your eyes are very much improved with this. Mother Earth also; if you put your head on the Mother Earth‚ just touch her with your forehead and say ""Mother forgive me for touching you with my feet"". She is Your Grandmother; you ask for any thing and you will get it. They are all waiting to give you whatever you want. You can ask the help of Hanumana‚ you can ask the help of Ganesha.
The other day the newspaper people told Me‚ the two disciples of Mine who are the correspondents‚ were going somewhere‚ and they had My photograph with them. They said that it was so amazing that our driver just bumped into a truck going ahead of us. We said that we are all finished‚ and we have closed our eyes. When we opened our eyes‚ the truck was ahead and we were there. We did not know how we were. Even the driver had closed his eyes.
We didn""t know how the truck went that side and how we were here! So accidents are avoided‚ and people have seen that they have good health and can live long. Everything is there. After all we have‚ jumped into the Kingdom of God. Only thing is to keep your seats all right for the time being. Then the whole thing is to be lifted up‚ into Satya Yuga. Already Satya Yuga has started.
My photo has the vibrations. It is a fact. Also there are many things that have vibrations. Even this statue has vibrations‚ but not so much as they are from Me. First of all I am a Living Being‚ and another thing is that their proportions may be wrong. They are created by the human beings‚ by their imaginations. But these Swayambhu Lingas‚ all of them have got it. For example‚ supposing you go to‚ say‚ this Ranjangaon‚ Ganesha‚ it has complete vibrations because these are special statues come out of the Mother Earth; Mother Earth throws out. Mother Earth thinks. She creates these things. She throws these things and they give vibrations. So you take vibrations from them also. But My photograph is the photograph of reality. Another thing is that whatever I speak‚ because I am That‚ it is Pranava flowing. It is actually Pranava. My every talk‚ everything is Mantra going into and when I put My finger into it‚ I have found that My vibrations can turn round. Even when I blow out air from My mouth‚ those who are Realized can feel it on their Sahasrara. It is a fact. So why should it look so funny to people?

14600,Seeking Divine Knowledge,,Question: If you see all the six Chakras; near each one there exists some or the other endocrine glands. What relation‚ do these Chakras have with the glands?,"Answer: Endocrine glands are controlled by the Chakras also. For example‚ we can say Mooladhara Chakra controls the Prostrate‚ like that. Even Agnya Chakra controls Pituitary and Pineal‚ both of them. That is how it controls the Ego and Super-Ego. So it has a controlling effect on that‚ very much. They are the gross agents for that. You see for example‚ to control all the nature‚ God has fixed up all the stars. Major nine stars are there. These are placed there to control the Universe and everything. It is controlled through those points. It also affects our physical and material life.

14740,Seeking Divine Knowledge,,"Q: When I am in Thoughtless Awareness‚ I can""t see clearly?","Answer: I think you must be seeing more than what you see normally. He is correct‚ when you are thoughtlessly aware your eyes‚ you see‚ the pupils start dilating‚ it""s correct. But take it higher‚ the Kundalini‚ slightly higher push it up‚ alright?
If Kundalini is staying at thoughtless awareness means just dilating and eyes can become black‚ but there""s no sparkle. But when it comes out then you find a ""sparkle"" in the eyes. There is a difference in the eyes‚ if you see‚ the eyes get dilated the pupils get dilated. When the Agnya Chakra is being just penetrated‚ that is still here it is then you can""t see clearly‚ correct. But at thoughtless awareness all this part‚ so if you push it up a little higher‚ you know how to push Kundalini with your attention‚ or you watch here or think of me‚ Kundalini will go up‚ alright?
So Thoughtless Awareness is just the beginning. And it""s a great area up to Shri Krishna point where you become the witness. Now the witness point when you have become‚ then there is sparkle in your eyes‚ your eyes sparkle. Sparkle in the eyes is a sign that the Kundalini is flowing well. That time you see more than you see normally and in the beginning it starts looking bigger‚ everything starts looking much clearer‚ alright? Dilatation of the pupil takes place. Some people really at that time have opened their eyes and they said ""Oh! We""ve become blind."" That""s true‚ it happens. It""s correct‚ alright?

How areweasSahajaYogistotalkaboutthis?,"Answer: Sahaja Yogis have to talk about how they should talk about the false gurus. You see those people who have been to false gurus are already suffering‚ they could even be quite mad. For example‚ I went to Chicago and there was one fellow of the Hare Rama Hare Krishna. He was the Chairman of Chicago Hare Rama Hare Krishna. He has shaved his hair with a little ponytail‚ a little bit like that coming out. I said ""Sir‚ I""m a Mother‚ why are you wearing this dhoti in this cold weather? It""s very cold you know I""m shivering."" He said that ""my guru has told me that if you wear a dhoti‚ you""ll get Moksha‚ Nirvana."" I said‚ ""What? In my country eighty percent wear this thing so they""d be there already."" He had shaved his hair. I said‚ ""Why did you shave your hair?"" He said ""That my guru has told me that that""s the station to get into the Heaven."" He was American you see. I said‚ ""There is Kabir‚ great poet in India‚ said that by shaving your head if you can get your place in Heaven‚ then what about the sheep that is shaved two times every year? The sheep must be already there. Where will you have the place?"" So he got very angry with me. ""You""re talking against my guru."" I said‚ ""See‚ you need not be angry with Me. Do what you like‚ your guru has said‚ but tomorrow if you get sick with this dhoti don""t come to Me."" This ""Hare Rama Hare Krishna"" we say everyday in India. We don""t say good morning like the English‚ we say Hare Ram. Just like the Muslims say something ""Allah""‚ so we say the same way. It""s just a lip service‚ how can you go to Heaven? He got angry but then he developed varicose veins. Next year he came to Me.
So to deal with them you have to be very careful. Firstly‚ they are slaves of their gurus‚ they have fixed ideas. Some of them just start shaking before Me‚ they fall on the ground but most of them now are finished. First thing they mesmerize. We have one in India who used to mesmerize and bring out Swiss watches and give to people. Lastly‚ there were very great people from India went to see him. There were four cameras. He could not mesmerize the camera. So the camera clearly showed how he brought a necklace and passed it on. And also our rich people in India are so stupid‚ rich not the poor. They used to go to him to get diamonds‚ can you imagine‚ I mean all kinds of tricks he did. But he was exposed by newspapers. They""re all getting exposed by God""s grace. All falsehood will get exposed. Firstly if you tell them that you don""t have to pay any money to the guru‚ all the gurus will jump into the sea.",https://www.amruta.org/p/6376,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14760,Seeking Divine Knowledge,,Q: How to achieve good attention?,"Answer: You don""t have to do anything because whatever you""ll do you""ll do through your mental activity. Mental activity is linear. There""s no truth in it. It goes up to a point‚ recoils back on you. But the power of Spirit spreads on all sides. Now they""re asking about attention‚ it""s very simple‚ when the Kundalini rises‚ the attention which is spread out here goes up like this‚ up. It is brought in the centre and at this Sahasrara it breaks. When it breaks you see this whole attention is filled with enlightenment. You don""t have to do anything‚ but you have to go on raising your Kundalini like this yourself‚ that""s all. When you watch something‚ watch it without thinking. Can you watch Me without thinking. Now you can feel the all-pervading power in your hands‚ see that. This is the Namaz‚ but Muslims don""t know anything. You will feel the cool breeze. This is the operating power and on your finger tips you will know about your centres and about the centres of others.

14770,Seeking Divine Knowledge,,Q: What are the curing powers coming from the supraconscious as there are so many people who are curing other people with supraconscious power and what is the difference between this curing power and curing power of the Kundalini?,"Answer: There can be two types of curing power. One could be those who get the power of the collective subconscious and those who get the power of collective supraconscious. Both can cure depending on where the problem is. For example a person with the power of the collective subconscious can cure problems of the Left side. And a supraconscious person can cure the physical side.
We have two types of people in India known as Mantrikas and Tantrikas. The Mantrikas are those people who go to the funerals and cemeteries and they try to capture the dead spirits. These dead spirits are of the sly type. These sly spirits are so-called ""social workers"" or ""busy-bodies"" trying to help others. They are in the category of Chaturvarnas or Shudras‚ thepeople who believe in serving others. They appear to be good people because they want to serve other people and help others and that is why they do not want to die and want to stay around the earth planet. One could call this a ""servant class"". They are absolutely servile. They like to be whipped‚ beaten-up and be ill-treated. They are another extreme. They enjoy a horrid type of existence – they are masochists. All such dead people are around us and they are left-sided bhoots i.e. very timid and clinging.
These Mantrikas get hold of such dead people and tell them to do this work or that work‚ control this or go there. And these bhoots feel very happy about it as they are servile. So‚ if there is someone suffering from a mental problem‚ for example‚ someone of his has died then he gets a mental push- back into the collective subconscious and gets possessed. Such people go to the Mantrikas and these Mantrikas tell the dead spirits that you have been troubling this man for a long time and you leave this man. So they remove this dead spirit and put another dead spirit in its place and tell the first dead spirit that he can get another body to go to. These Mantrikas are the mediators or liaison officers. They catch hold of these spirits and remove them from one man and put them onto some other person. So the first person is ""cured"".
For example‚ there was a lady whose husband used to drink quite a lot. She went to one of the lady Mantrikas who said she will cure her husband but the lady must pay Rs.100 for that. So she put a dead spirit on this man by which the ""bhoot"" of the drunkard on him was removed. So this man gave up drinking but he started going to races. Then she solved that problem by removing the ""races"" bhoot"" and put another one by which he started going to dirty women. Now this lady got frightened. Every time she would pay Rs.100 and had ended up by paying a lot of money. Then she complained to the lady Mantrika about it. After that she found that her husband was doing all the three things together. So she went to fight with that lady Mantrika‚ who put a bhoot on her too. Since then‚ that woman is still mad and I have not been able to cure her. She is a very good-looking woman married to a very rich man who owns a factory and this is the life both of them are leading i.e. burning the candle on both ends. This is the case of the subconscious people.
The second case is of the people of supraconscious type. For example ""Dr. ""X""""s International Curative Centre"". ""International bhoots"" he had! You have to write to them that you are suffering from such and such disease. All the dead supraconscious people the very ambitious type i.e. all the ""great"" doctors‚ all the ""great"" lawyers‚ all the ""great"" scientists‚ all the ""great"" engineers and architects‚ Hitler and all such ""great"" warriors gather on the right hand side.
When Dr. ""X"" died he met all his friends there and he could communicate with them because these doctors did not want to die as they had been experimenting with this or that. So they started Dr. ""X""""s Clinic. Now this Dr. ""X"" who died lived in London and had a son. Dr. ""X""""s spirit attacked an ordinary soldier in Vietnam and told him that he was Dr. ""X"" from London and that he better go to his son and tell him that you want to start such a clinic. He did not attack his son as he knew that his son would not be able to bear him as the son was not healthy. He wanted a very healthy and sturdy man whom he could possess.
So the soldier went to his son and said that ""your father is within me and he wants to open a clinic"". The son would not believe it. So the soldier went into trance and told him that I have got some money in the secret place kept for you and he had talked in secret about it. So the son believed and started the clinic for him. He gave all that money for the clinic. And all the ""Bhoot doctors"" were helping this man to act whenever he wanted and an intercommunication was established on that level i.e. the collective supraconscious.
A lady who was suffering from high blood pressure‚ kidney and uterus problems went to them. They told her to write a letter to the centre in London who wrote back that on this particular day‚ at this particular time we will appear within you and cure you but you must lie down in your bed. On that particular day and at that particular time she started shivering and one of the ""dead doctors"" entered into her and she got cured. For one year she was alright. But then she started feeling very dizzy. When she came to me she was in a tattered condition. Absolutely finished. She knew that a spirit had come in her at the time she came to see me. She said and knew that there were at least ten or eleven within her and she could not bear them.
So this kind of curing also take place from the supraconscious. Supposing there is an architect and he approaches such people he can get the spirit of a dead architect upon himself. Now this Jack the Ripper was possessed of the spirit of a dead ripper. One has to have an inclination for such things. This weakness is there within such people. That is why they are easily possessed. Otherwise it does not happen. Only if you are weak in mind and have weaknesses for such things‚ then these dead spirits can catch hold of you. If it has something to do with your physical side then the supraconscious can help you. If it has something to do with your mental side then the subconscious people can help you. But they help you very temporarily and then come back with a big foursome.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/4642,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You don""t have to put your hands‚ you don""t have to ask questions but it""s like a computer that works; it just gives you an answer. In that state you are completely one with the Divine‚ and it just gives you an answer‚ and you do that and you are amazed how it has worked out. Everything‚ every moment is computerized with Shri Krishna.
But at the same time He tests you‚ He plays His Leela on you. That one must know‚ because He""s a diplomat. How He has played Leela on you is very interesting to see‚ His style of Leela.
Like He""s told Arjuna that ""I will not fight"". Arjuna said‚ ""All right‚ what will you do""? ""I""ll be your charioteer. I""ll drive your chariot"". Now it would look funny to anybody‚ ""What is this‚ such a great man who calls me as His guru‚ He says that He is the one who‚ I mean‚ He says that I am the best of His disciples‚ everything‚ and here He just offers His services like a charioteer"". In this‚ He is just trying a trick on Arjuna as if He knows the future‚ that""s going to happen. So‚ the whole Gita was created because He was just a charioteer‚ because Arjuna said ""I cannot fight my own people‚ I cannot fight my own grandparents‚ and I cannot fight my relations."" Now‚ if you say that Gita is for peace‚ it is not. It is not for peace. But He says that‚ ""They are already dead‚ whom are you killing? These dead people‚ if you are killing them what will happen? But if you now run away from the battlefield‚ people will call you a coward and what will you get? But if you fight for the religion‚ then you will get your resurrection – moksha.""
It""s a big trick in all these things. Same was said by Mohammed Sahib and same by Christians later‚ same about the Hindus - that they all feel they are fighting for Dharma. In Arjuna""s case‚ it was a clear-cut case that somebody was a rakshasa and horrible people‚ they were adharmis‚ so He was fighting them. It""s alright‚ but what about other people when they say that ""We are going to die for religion."" I met a Bosnia Muslim who had just somewhere escaped and I asked Him ""Why‚ why do you want to fight? Why do you want to fight for land when you believe in the formless God?"" He said‚: ""It""s written in the Koran that if you fight for religion then you will get your moksha."" Exactly the same Shri Krishna has said. But where is the mistake? The mistake is: what is the Dharma? Are you dharmic? Are you in - standing in Dharma? Then this fight was in those days‚ were with weapons. So‚ why did Shri Krishna not take a weapon in His hand? This is the second. Firstly‚ nobody has Dharma‚ they""re all adharmis - they may call themselves Hindus‚ Muslims‚ Christians - all are adharmis‚ they don""t follow the religion. And secondly‚ they are killing each other only; one adharmi killing other adharmi‚ or maybe in between themselves they are fighting. Everybody is thinking ""I am right and whatever I am doing is the right."" So‚ the first condition is put‚ that for Dharma you have to fight. So first one should find out‚ are we fighting for Dharma? But He was even subtler; He didn""t take any weapons in His hands‚ nothing. He was just holding the reins of the chariot because Shri Krishna is the mind‚ is the Virata‚ is the Great Mind. He doesn""t need any weapons or such.
But what He did at that time‚ He used His mind for a very‚ very profound knowledge‚ to explain to Arjuna. Imagine‚ in the war field‚ He didn""t make him sit down ""Alright‚ you are my Shishya‚ you sit here‚ I am your guru‚ I""ll tell you."" - Nothing. In the battlefield you see‚ when everybody was there to fight and they were about to start the war‚ He starts telling very patiently to Arjuna‚ at that time. Now‚ what is He doing there? He""s not using any weapons‚ nothing. He is doing counselling‚ counselling to Arjuna‚ telling him. Now‚ see His subtle brain. He introduces in the first chapter only that ""You have to go higher than what you are""‚ and then He gives him the definition of a person who is an enlightened person which is a Sthitha Pragya. I mean‚ normally‚ a businessman will start from one dollar‚ then hundred dollars‚ you see‚ the other way round. But He told him first thing that ""You have to become a Sthitha Pragya‚ otherwise it""s no use."" Unless and until you become Sthitha Pragya you cannot have Dharma‚ this is the point. To understand Shri Krishna‚ you have to really have a very subtle brain‚ otherwise you cannot understand. So He tells that ""You should give up this kind of a morose that has developed in you‚ Kaivalya we call it and what you have to do‚ now take up the weapon in your hand and fight.""
So then He asked him about other things‚ ""What about that‚ you are here telling me that you should become Nishkriya that means ""no work"". Your karmas become akarmas. You‚ talking like this‚ and why do you want me to kill these people - that is the akarma?"" Now‚ how you see‚ slowly He moves from one point that you should fight for Dharma. Now‚ it""s a very subtle thing: are you in Dharma or not‚ first of all find out. You are not‚ so what Dharma you fight‚ first?
Then‚ the second thing is karma. Again‚ see‚ He is a brainy fellow‚ the brains of God‚ extremely tricky.The second trick He plays on him saying that ""You are working‚ alright? But if you are a Sthitha Pragya‚ then you leave all the work at the lotus feet of God"" or Him. Sarva Dharmanam Parityajjya Mamekam Sharanam Vraja - Give up all Dharmas and follow Me.
Now what is his Dharma? That problem is that people don""t understand Him. It""s all concentrated on Shri Krishna‚ and His own manifestation. He says that ""Do your karmas‚ but you put them at the lotus feet of the Lord"" - is not possible unless and until you are Sthitha Pragya; unless and until you are enlightened. Now‚ when you are enlightened‚ when you have got your Realization‚ when you raise your Kundalini or anybody""s Kundalini‚ you don""t say ""Mother‚ I am giving Realization"". You don""t say that‚ never. What you say‚ ""It is happening""‚ in third person you talk. ""It""s not coming‚ it""s not working or it""s just moving on the side‚ this chakra is catching‚ that chakra is catching."" You never say ""I am doing anything."" The ""I"" is lost. When that ""I"" is lost‚ then only you will put everything at the lotus feet of God. So‚ first‚ it should be done in Dharma. Supposing‚ somebody murders somebody and says ""Oh‚ I have done it now‚ so it is my karmas and I put it at the lotus feet of Shri Krishna."" Now‚ people can‚ I mean‚ people have special brains also to interpret Shri Krishna and Gita‚ but what He said for Dharma you should do it. So‚ first of all‚ you should be a Sthitha Pragya‚ means an enlightened person‚ and whatever you do automatically goes at the lotus feet of God‚ automatically‚ spontaneously‚ Sahaj.
Now‚ the third thing He did: what about bhakti? People said ""What? We are doing bhakti to God‚ this‚ that‚ then what is the reward for this?"" There again He plays tricks. On one word He has made everybody dance‚ you know. He says ""You do bhakti‚ but it should be Anannya‚"" - this is the word‚ Ananya‚ - when there is not the other‚ means when you have become One with Me‚ means you are a Sthitha Pragya‚ means you are a Realized Soul. Just imagine‚ on this word if people pay attention‚ they will give up all this nonsense of bhakti and will first get their connection when they become Ananya‚ and then do the bhakti. Because Shri Krishna knew human beings very well. I think He knew them better than Christ‚ definitely‚ because Christ was straightforward. He said‚ ""Take out your right eye‚ throw it away. Take out your left eye‚ throw it away. Cut your hand‚ throw it away."" Same with Mohammed Sahib. Who will do that? So Shri Krishna was very clever‚ He said‚ ""straightforward they will not understand‚ so give them in such a way that they will go on doing and doing"". We are doing so much bhakti‚ so many people come into it. Even this Ram‚ Hare Ramas‚ they are developing now throat cancers. So‚ they are saying ""Mother‚ why these throat cancer to us‚ we are saying the name of Shri Krishna?"" Because you are not connected. Now supposing‚ I will even want to meet the President of this country. I""ll have to go through such a protocol. I may not even meet. But this One is the God of Gods. He is the President of all the presidents. If you have to take His name‚ if you go and take name of Lincoln‚ or Clinton‚ and go on saying ""Clinton‚ Clinton Clinton""‚ they""ll all arrest Me. So‚ if you go on saying ""Rama‚ Rama‚ Rama‚ Allah‚ Allah‚ Allah‚ Akbar‚ Akbar‚ Akbar""‚ you""ll be arrested. You have no connection. So‚ that Virata Shakti which we call‚ which is of course in Koran described as Akbar‚ this power also plays tricks.
As a Mother‚ I have to warn you that nothing will work out unless (and) until you are a Realized Soul. Nothing will work out. Now‚ for Realization‚ He has said‚ ""You have to become."" But He didn""t say at that time how you will become‚ what will work it out. Because you see‚ sort of‚ if you go to college‚ all the knowledge is not given in first year. Something is given‚ then something in second year‚ then in third year. Now in the seventh year‚ now Sahaja Yoga has come to tell you everything‚ totally. He is Totality‚ but He doesn""t give total knowledge. The whole knowledge of Gita is nothing but trick that He has played with human beings who were stupid‚ and would never have understood Him if He""d told them about Sahaja Yoga. Even today I meet many like that‚ of course‚ but so many He could not have got at that time. So‚ they didn""t talk about Kundalini this much‚ so far‚ and that""s all. Same with other people; the kind of disciples they had‚ the kind of people they had‚ they could not tell them everything about their ascent‚ because they were not ready‚ they were not of that level‚ their brains were not that developed.
Now in this Kali Yuga‚ when I am starting this work‚ I find the brains are overdeveloped‚ over! And so much so that overdeveloped brains become stupid and that""s really. Over use of anything makes you stupid‚ and they become absolutely stupid. Now‚ how can you tell them such a subtle knowledge who are stupid people? What is the way? If I talk like Shri Krishna it would have been just a waste of My energy and your energy. Half of you would have gone off to sleep. So I said‚ first of all‚ let Me connect them to Divinity. If I could connect them to Divinity‚ little bit even‚ little bit‚ then they will understand. Because that will enlighten their brain a little bit‚ and they will know that there""s something more than what we know. And that""s how it is going to work out.
So the subtle system of trickery of Shri Krishna has helped a lot‚ no doubt‚ that people are realizing that there is something missing in it. Even of Islam - Islam means surrender - but surrender to whom; to mullahs or to whom? The problem started when hierarchy started like that.   ...  ...""
 .Now‚ whatever Mohammed Sahib has said or Christ has said‚ it is only for angels‚ I can tell you‚ not for normal people. And where are the angels? Very few there are. Those are born-Realized people who have come on this earth are angels‚ and they are told not to do something they will not do. Most of them know what is right and wrong. Where are those angels‚ very few? And those who are angels are treated just like‚ you can call it‚ like packed people or lunatic people‚ nobody believes them; one here‚ and one there‚ and one in some other place.
So this‚ what they preached was for the angels. Only the angels could understand. But Shri Krishna thought that these other people who are there‚ who are not angels‚ why not trick them? Many people come and tell me‚ ""We take the name of Krishna every day like this‚ and we haven""t received anything."" But first He said‚ ""You have to be Sthitha Pragya."" Sthitha- Pragya: ""Sthitha"" means established‚ ""Pragya"" means enlightened‚ - you should be enlightened personality‚ absolutely established. First thing‚ first thing you see‚ in a second chapter. First thing is it. After that He says all these things‚ and that""s why many people have misunderstood Gita. But His idea was: in one life they""ll misunderstand‚ second life they""ll misunderstand‚ third life they will start thinking ""After all‚ what is this?"" First‚ He has said ""You become a Sthitha Pragya""‚ we have not become a Sthitha Pragya. So‚ what""s wrong with us? So‚ some introspection will start. That was His idea‚ idea I should say.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/6418,,Thoughtless awareness,,,,,,,,,,,,Shri Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14820,Seeking Divine Knowledge,,"It""s Me who is Shri Krishna‚ so you must know what you owe to Me","""Mentally‚ I think that most of the Sahaja Yogis understand that obedience to the Divinity is the only way - mentally‚ rationally. Now even if you understand something mentally‚ it""s not your innate nature. So what I told you yesterday‚ when you accept something mentally and you cannot do it‚ you feel guilty about it. Then you become your own guru and punish yourself‚ and try to make this as your innate nature. It""s a state‚ it clicks. Once it clicks you can see immediately. I know who is surrendered.
So Shri Krishna has said that : ""Sarva dharmanam Parityajjya Ma mekam Sharanam Vraja"". He has said that ""Give up all your dharmas and surrender them to Me‚ surrender to My dharma only"". So the dharmas we  have in our country as we say is a ""pitra dharma""‚ what you owe to your father‚ ""matru dharma"" what you owe to your mother‚ then what you owe to your husband‚ like that‚ you see‚ that relationship in which you owe to them. But when He says ""surrender all these dharmas""‚ He is meaning to say ""you should only know what you owe to Me"" meaning the Divinity. Now Shri Krishna is not there. It""s Me who is Shri Krishna‚ so you must know what you owe to Me. I only changed My language. He used to take out His finger and to say that ""give up everything and surrender everything to Me"".

14830,Seeking Divine Knowledge,,  ...many things will happen‚ that you will see something that you could never imagine,"""In the first era of Sahaja Yoga‚ you needed to see Me in person. As we say in Sanskrit‚ a ""Dhyeya""‚ is the target‚ you wanted the target in front of you‚ whatever is to be achieved. So now when you wanted that all the time and you felt happy‚ secure‚ joyous‚ when you had that in person before you. Then‚ in the second era‚ now‚ you will not desire so much that Mother should be there. You""ll take it over from Me. This is the Divine Desire I""m telling you about‚ and you have to work on that from today onwards. I am with you‚ you know that‚ but need not be in this body‚ because I don""t know if I exist in this body or not. But once this desire starts working‚ you will see tremendous miracles happening.
When the child is born to a mother‚ automatically she gets milk. So the nature is so connected with the whole thing. In your divine desire also it is connected‚ and it is very evident when you are a divine person. So you may find Me anywhere‚ you are walking on the street‚ suddenly you might find Mataji walking with you. So this is the second era we have started‚ and you should not be shocked if you see Me sitting on your bed and putting My hand on your head‚ or you may see Me in the form of Christ walking into your room‚ or as Shri Rama. That has to happen‚ so you should be prepared.
Already so many miracles have taken place on you‚ but on a grosser level. You have seen the light coming on My head and the photographs have shown some miracles to you‚ but many things will happen‚ that you will see something that you could never imagine. This has to happen just to convince you that you have reached a certain height of your evolution in the new area of Pragyalok because this is a new state into which now you will be entering on a horizontal basis. In this area you will give up asking for gross things‚ and also for anything subtler‚ anything that is subtle‚ the asking will disappear‚ and that is the time you will become very powerful. Whatever I say happens as you know‚ only thing‚ I cannot command you to be evolved.

They take Me into confidence completely. Without children‚ the world would have been desert without any flowers. Shri Ganesha has created you; because of Him you were born and He is the one who looked after you when you were in Mother""s womb. He is the one who saw to it that you are born at the right time. He is the one who has looked after your nourishment‚ the development of the foetus and the brain. A simple villager is extremely practical and wise. Once a simple villager was traveling with some flamboyant boys who thought they were very smart. They were trying to tease this villager. So a boy asked him a question. ""If the butter is selling for a quarter of a pound‚ what will be the price of the egg in the next station? If you can not tell the price of an egg‚ then you can at least tell me my age.""

Only thing is that it is for you to respect it and behave in a manner that you respect your innocence. Do not feel shy about your innocence.

That""s the job of Shri Krishna.
The story you must have heard about Narada who never wanted to see‚ who thought he was a great man because he was never attracted to a woman‚ and he was challenging even Shiva. Then Shri Krishna played a trick on him‚ He always plays tricks. He sent two Gandharvas to tease him. They went down and they asked Narada. They said ""You are such a beautiful man‚ such a handsome person‚ there is a marriage going on of a lady Roopabati. She is very beautiful‚ she is a princess and why don""t you go there‚ she""ll definitely marry you"" and they pampered his ego‚ you see‚ such a lot‚ he started floating in the air.

She looked at him and she giggled first and then she laughed aloud and then she went away. He couldn""t understand‚ looked at these two persons‚ they said ""It""s all right‚ now‚ it doesn""t matter‚ maybe somebody is better looking‚ then you."" So Narada was very angry‚ he went to the lake. When he looked into the lake‚ his face was like a monkey. He""s become a monkey because this ego makes you a monkey and you start thinking ah‚ you are great‚ you are very beautiful‚ you are this thing‚ that thing  ...

Do you boast of that? Whatever you are not‚ then you boast ""I am very beautiful‚ I am very good looking‚ others are ugly‚ this thing."" Then Shri Krishna plays a part through the Maya and He gives a big lesson to that person. It happens.
So‚ never think that you are something great‚ or you have achieved this in life and achieved that in life‚ and that you are something a big Johnny.

14890,Seeking Divine Knowledge,,He was created as an egg; half of it remained as Shri Ganesha‚ and half of it became Mahavishnu.," When He was created in the beginning as Shri Ganesha - you know the story how He was created; that the ""maila"" (extracted remains of the perfumed herbal paste applied on the body ‚ called ubtan‚ prepared out of flour‚ perfumes and earth elements as body conditioner before bathing) from the body of Parvati was taken out because before Her marriage She had to cover Herself for Her bath with many scented things‚ and it was taken out‚ all these things‚ and Her vibrations came out. And She created this Child just to protect Her chastity. Outside Her bathroom She put Him and you know the whole story about it.
Now‚ there was a part of the element of the earth in that Child; ""prithvi- tattwa"" was there. All other centres‚ have got some elements in them‚ some elements‚ like prithvi tattwa is there‚ earth element.
Then you have got water element‚ then you have got air element‚ and when you come to this: it is the light element‚ it""s the light. And‚ at this point‚ at Agnya chakra‚ He had to cross the last element‚ that was the light element‚ that means He had to come out into the true form of only the Divine Power‚ the Aumkara‚ the vibrations you can call it or the absolute. You call it the logos or something like that‚ the first sound - Brahma.
So He had to become the principle of Brahma. To become principle of Brahma‚ He had to get rid of all other elements in Him. So‚ the last was also the light element which He also had to cross through. So He had earth element in Him as He was of the ""maila""‚ and all other elements within Him‚ but when it comes to the Agnya‚ He had to give up all the elements‚ that He had to die the death of all these elements that were within Him - to become complete‚ absolute‚ pure Spirit.
What He did in subtle form works out in the gross form‚ and to do that He had to die‚ and whatever died in Him was that little earth element and other elements. And what came out of Him was Pure Spirit‚ was ""Pure Spirit"". That was resurrected; the Pure Spirit‚ the pure Brahma Tattwa which had formed the body of Christ which was the body of Christ and this happening came. Christ has done what was predicted about Him: that He""s a Saviour because He passed through that gate to take people from this bodily existence - means the one that depends on the elements - to that existence which is Spirit.
So the Resurrection is where you become. From your attention you jump into the attention of the Spirit‚ when you feel your attention‚ when you become the Spirit. That is the happening which has happened to you also. But He became pure Spirit‚ pure Brahma Tattwa‚ when He was resurrected and the Resurrection is a happening of the Divine Power which came from Mooladhara chakra as just earth element‚ started growing. It took its birth from there‚ came up to Agnya chakra‚ there Christ was created to pass through all the elements‚ ultimately to enter the Sahasrara to become a complete Brahma Tattwa.
And this was a very difficult thing‚ was very experimental; and the experiment was a quite dangerous one. It could have failed because He had in Him that human element‚ the body element‚ which suffers. And He suffered‚ because this body element suffers - not the Spirit‚ the Spirit does not suffer‚ the body suffers. So‚ He had to suffer that body element and to get over it‚ to get out of it. And to get out of it‚ He had to have a tremendous courage. It was such a difficult operation‚ without Him nobody could have achieved. He knew it was predestined‚ but it was one of the most difficult things to happen.
I wonder how many Christians know the significance of an egg. Now egg signifies a stage where you are‚ before Realization. When you are in your egg shell‚ that you are Mr X‚ you are Mrs Y‚ but when you mature fully inside‚ the bird is ready and that is the time you are hatched. This is the time you get twice-born. So‚ the Resurrection of Christ signifies that‚ and that""s why we give that egg to people‚ saying you are that‚ an egg‚ a reminder of that. And this egg can become a Spirit. And also it is written that it was an egg when He came first. He was created as an egg - half of it remained as Shri Ganesha‚ and half of it became Mahavishnu.
Then He came on this earth and He departed with all His elements and the pure vibrations formed His body. He remained there within all of you to be awakened and when the Kundalini takes your attention through that point there you also become the Spirit. That""s why He said ""I am the gate‚ I am the door"" because you can become Christ. That""s why He didn""t say ""I""m the destination‚"" that you have to achieve Him. But‚ He has created this space for you. You can become spiritually awakened; you can become your Spirit.
But‚ Christ is an incarnation. He was the Son of God‚ and so He""s an incarnation‚ and that incarnation came on this earth just to pull you out of your elements to make you become the Spirit.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/4670,,,,,,,,Agnya,,,Ganesha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Qualities,Chastity,

They don""t understand anything‚ and they can""t understand why people worship snakes. You see‚ snakes like the cobra and all that are like the kings of the underworld‚ and Shesha is the one who supports the whole universe. So this Shesha is worshipped as the cobras are worshipped in many villages in India anywhere today. Because they don""t trouble anyone there‚ because they are worshipped like deities in India‚ sometimes they do‚ but mostly they don""t bite a good religious man.
There""s a story of Sai Nath where a snake charmer was given a lot of money just to kill Shri Sai Nath. Because in the night Sai Nath used to suddenly go up to his own swing he had made about twenty feet above the ground. God knows‚ nobody knew how he used to get up there‚ but they would find him sleeping there. So the snake was taken by this snake charmer and he put the snake on to Sai Nath. And Sai Nath talked to him and he said‚ ""Oh God‚ you""ve come here to meet me after such a long time. What is your job?""
Snake said‚ ""This horrible snake charmer has asked me to bite you so I""ve come to tell you to be careful about these people.""
The snake charmer was looking with amazement that he was talking to him! Sai Nath said‚ ""Alright‚ you go now.""
These are age-old snakes you see. So the snake went and bit the snake charmer. But then He came down and He sucked his poison and threw it away. ""Because‚ after all‚"" He said‚ ""the snake is angry with you because you tried such a trick."" So He sucked it. That""s compassion. And He sucked his venom out and the fellow was completely changed and he said‚ ""Now I""m going to announce it to all the people that these Brahmins wanted to kill Shri Sai Nath.""
And why‚ why were they so frightened of this man? He used to live outside the village. They were frightened of Him because they were doing all wrong things in the name of God so they were all frightened that they""d be exposed.
This is what it is‚ that He sleeps on the Shesha and Shesha is the one who is sometimes expressed in Sahaja Yogis‚ I have seen as anger‚ when you try to be unprotocolish or when you try to be funny or you don""t behave yourself. That""s the Shesha in them. That is also sometimes needed. You have to be a Shesha sometimes‚ otherwise people will start misbehaving‚ and by that they will be harmed.

14910,Seeking Divine Knowledge,,Sahaja Yogis who are like Shesha cannot see the goodness of other Sahaja Yogis who are very good people," But the other one is very interesting‚ is that of Bharata. Shri Rama bestowed the kingdom on him because of his mother""s agitation. He didn""t know what to do so he went back to Rama and he said‚ ""You take back Your kingdom. I don""t want anything. You are the one who should govern. Why should I have it?"" So Rama said‚ ""Alright‚ you just be there in charge of the kingdom. I have to obey My father‚ I have to obey My mother because I have given them a promise.""
So another great quality of Shri Rama was that once a promise is given‚ it is to be kept. This is another quality that we have to have‚ that if you have promised anything you have to keep it. If you have said‚ ""I will do this""‚ you must do it. You should not find out excuses to avoid it. It""s an absolutely anti- God activity‚ to avoid doing things that you have promised. Your deities will never be happy. You must see that whatever you have promised you must do.
Now when Bharata was sent back by Him he said‚ ""Alright‚ give me Your sandals which I""ll take there and I""ll use them as a symbol of You being there."" And Bharata put those sandals on the throne and he ruled that kingdom and looked after it.
Though when he was going to see Shri Rama‚ Lakshmana saw him coming and said‚ ""Look at this! He is coming to invade You now. He has thrown You out of the kingdom and now he""s coming to invade You.""
And also among Sahaja Yogis I""ve seen that this is there. That the Sahaja Yogis who are like Shesha cannot see the goodness of other Sahaja Yogis who are very good people‚ extremely sacrificing‚ nice people but their intentions are not understood‚ are misunderstood‚ which is a very sad thing. You must see the intentions also of another type of people who may not be so hot tempered‚ may not be so much angry but their intentions are very good. They have come actually to ask for the sandals of Shri Rama.
So among these two types of people‚ I have seen there is always a misunderstanding going on. So both the types of people should try to understand that we both are needed for Sahaja Yoga. I cannot only do with one type of people. We have to have both types of people who will look after both the styles of the thing.
But when you are dealing with others‚ one should go as one. For example‚ if a person comes to Caxton Hall and he says something‚ then you should weigh it whether he""s a new one or an old one. If he""s a new one then you must show all gentleness‚ kindness‚ all kinds of exterior things which will please. The reason is that he""s not a Realized Soul. He doesn""t see your subtle thing. What he sees is what you are. Outside. How you are dressed. How you talk to him. How you behave towards him. All these things they see first of all. They don""t see what you have got inside. They can""t see your heart. They can""t feel your vibrations. So you have to be very kind to them. You have to be very sweet to them.
I received a letter from someone saying that the Sahaja Yogis have been very rude to me and have been angry. Like the other day somebody came and was sitting at the back. They are trying to salvage the people who are lost by the cults. He was sitting at the back and I said‚ ""Come forward."" And when he didn""t come‚ you said‚ ""Get out."" You shouldn""t say that! Let Me say that. That time you should keep quiet. No one should say‚ ""Get out."" Because‚ you see‚ the thing is if you say‚ ""We don""t care for people who are not humble""‚ then they are going to be lost anyway. Let us give them a fair chance to come into Sahaja Yoga first by your behaviour.
Now‚ some people have a habit of talking to them a bit too much. They should not talk. That""s one thing I feel. That while giving vibrations and all that at the most you should ask‚ ""Are you feeling any cool breeze?"" Very humble.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/2827,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

14930,Seeking Divine Knowledge,,Shri Krishna is very sick‚ He has got a terrible pain in His stomach.," I will tell you a very sweet story of Shri Krishna and Radha and then I will go away. Once it happened that the ladies who were married to Shri Krishna got very jealous of Radhaji. And they told Shri Krishna that you don""t love us. On top of that Shri Narada came to put more oil on the fire. That he said. ""He really‚ I believe‚ He never cares for you‚ He just likes Radhaji. He is not bothered.
So Shri Krishna‚ as diplomatic as He was‚ He started saying‚ ""Oh God! I have terrible pain in My stomach‚ now what to do?"" So they said‚ ""now what to do?"" He said‚ ""It is very simple. You know any one who is my Bhakta (devotee)‚ if you can give the dust of your feet to Me to eat‚ then I will be alright."" So they got a fright of their life‚ you see.
As it is if I tell you anything‚ you just want to give your solutions everytime. Nobody listens to Me. If I say go here- ""No‚ no‚ it is better to go that way."" Come here- ""No‚ no‚ this way is better"". Everybody has a brain wave about it. Does not matter. So there they had brain waves. They said you see why don""t you take some medicine? Then somebody said‚ ""We will call the Vaidya."" He said‚ ""No‚ I know for definite that I cannot be cured by anything else but one thing‚ that you have to get the dust of one of my Bhaktas‚ and I will eat.""
So everybody started looking at each other‚ you see. As some of the Sahaja Yogis do when it comes to paying! They never heard it. Some of them never heard. Better. You see‚ it is very tricky nature. So they said ""Now what to do. If we do not cure Shri Krishna‚ He is just wailing and what to do?"" Shri Krishna said‚ ""Have some pity on Me‚ give Me some dust of your feet."" So He said to Narada that you go and ask Radha to send dust of Her feet. So he went to Shri Radha. Shri Radhaji was in Vrindavan‚ and the soil of that place is yellowish in colour like Keshar‚ like saffron. So he went and told that Shri Krishna is very sick‚ He has got a terrible pain in His stomach.
She got a fright. She said‚ ""Really? How can that be? I cannot believe it. So what does He say? What treatment can He take?"" ""He says anyone of His disciples‚ anybody of His Bhakta‚ if they send a little of the dust of their feet‚ He will be alright. He has to take that as a medicine."" So She said alright‚ take the dust of My feet. He was amazed! He said‚ ""What are you doing? You understand‚ if you give Him the dust of your feet‚ then all your punyas (merits) will be lost. He is playing some trick‚ you know. Just don""t try this thing."" She said‚ ""Nothing doing‚ you better take it."" But he said‚ ""what about Your punyas and papas."" She said‚ ""I know one thing‚ it is He‚ who looks after My papas and punyas. I have not to think about it.""
So he took the dust of Her feet which was absolutely yellow like a saffron or like a pollen of the flower. And he went and gave it to Shri Krishna. Shri Krishna said‚ ""I knew Shri Radha will send‚ now let Me eat it."" He said‚ ""You can eat‚ but you have to answer the question‚ that Shri Radha has said‚ that you look after Her papas and punyas. How is it? How can it be? What does that mean? That you know what her punya and what papas are and She is not bothered about it. She has not to worry about Her papas and punyas."" He said‚ ""Alright‚ now let Me take the medicine."" He took the medicine and He said I better sleep. And Shri Narada saw the heart of Shri Krishna opened and in the heart was the lotus of a very beautiful pink colour. On that lotus was lying Shri Radhaji. And Her feet were rubbing against the pollen of that lotus and the yellow of the Vrindavan clay was the same colour as that. And then he realized that when She is touching that lotus with Her feet‚ what does it matter if She gives the dust of Her feet to Shri Krishna to take. She is in His heart. When Her feet are in His heart‚ what does it matter? And that is how they realized that Shri Radha""s love was so great that for Her She did not think of Dharma-Adharma‚ but just to be at the command of Her Lord‚ She acted‚ and that is how She had a place in the Heart of Shri Krishna.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/4686,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Shri Krishna,Shri Radha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If Freud was there‚ he would have said‚ oh this is all nonsense. What""s wrong? Go ahead. Krishna did not do that. He wanted to break all the nonsensical shackles of traditions and shackles of false fanaticism. But He did it in a very beautiful manner keeping the relationships absolutely pure.
Now people ask questions‚ Mother‚ was He married to Radha? He is eternally married to Her‚ doesn""t matter. But He actually performed the marriage‚ just the day He was born. He was brought by His father across the river and put down on the bank of the river‚ when Shri Brahmadeva Himself came on this earth.

14980,Seeking Divine Knowledge,,"The ""Siddhis"" are mostly available at this stage. Not minor Siddhis but higher Siddhis","""Now we were talking about ""Sat-Chit-Anand"". Again I have to use Sanskrit words. ""Sat-Chit-Anand"" is the ""Super Consciousness""‚ the all pervading power. ""Chit"" is the attention‚ the ""Consciousness"". You are just now conscious and listening to Me. Every minute‚ you are conscious. But every moment is becoming dead into the past. Every moment is coming from the future to the present. But you are conscious at this moment and are listening to Me. A thought rises and falls. You can see the rising of the thought‚ but not the falling of the thought. In between these thoughts‚ there is a space called ""Vilamb"". If you can stop for a while‚ you get to the Conscious Mind and there exists the ""Sat-Chit-Anand"". You can say ""Sat- Chit-Anand"" is the condition of the mind or the state of mind‚ where there is no thought‚ but you are aware ""Nirvichara"". This is the first stage‚ where you jump into; into the ""Super Consciousness"".
Some people may think‚ that by Realization you must achieve something as Adi Shankaracharya did‚ but it is not possible. With some it may be‚ but with everyone it is not possible. Your first stage is Nirvichara. You become thoughtlessly aware. That happens when the Kundalini rises above the Agnya Chakra meaning enters into the limbic area‚ when your attention just touches ""Sat"" point. The reality separates from ""Mithya"". You become two personalities. At that state you start separating‚ like putting lime in the milk when it starts separating into curd and water. In the same way the beginning of reality starts. This is the state when you can say that the Kundalini has awakened only. We must understand the different stages‚ as it happens.
I am giving you a very detailed picture but normally the Kundalini shoots off to ""Sahasrara"" in most of the people. In some people it does not. It takes time. It is either lost into the Swadhishthana or the Nabhi. It does not go much higher. It is arrested by ""Anahata Chakra"" or it may not even rise at all. But in case it crosses this ""door"" of Agnya Chakra‚ then you get into the state of ""thoughtless awareness"". With this thoughtless awareness‚ you get certain powers. Supposing for example‚ you become the Governor‚ you get certain powers of the Governor. Similarly you attain certain powers. 
But at this stage to leave the Kundalini is not proper‚ because the Kundalini can start moving to this side or that side and can thus go to the supra conscious or to the collective sub-conscious. The ""Siddhis"" are mostly available at this stage. Not minor Siddhis but higher Siddhis‚ e.g.‚ if the Kundalini moves to supra-conscious one gets the Siddhi of predicting the future. If the Kundalini has moved to the Collective Subconscious‚ they can start seeing things in the past. A person like that‚ when he comes to Me‚ can see who I was in My previous life. I do not have to convince him. This is the same thing as anybody who is possessed. A person who takes to drugs and is an alcoholic to the last word‚ but is a good Soul and is still seeking God‚ such a person can see Me‚ in a different form. He can see My past‚ he can be very much enamoured by Me. He would know who I was. People think that the past is greater than the present‚ always‚ because the past has been much greater than today‚ though I have never given Realization to anyone previously. He‚ therefore‚ gets enamoured when he sees things like that. This happens to people who are on the Supra conscious level if they move out on the left hand side i.e.‚ into the past.
Those who move out on the right hand side can see Me as light. They see all the five elements; they see Me as a waterfall or as an iceberg. They start seeing the ""Tanmatra"" namely the causal essence of the elements. It may help them to get convinced‚ because such a person gets convinced about Me and such a person is much more convinced than you are. There are good many Tantrikas who know who I was. They are afraid of Me and they talk about Me. There was an ordinary maid servant who came to My programme and she got into a trance and started speaking Sanskrit and she described me completely in fifteen ""Shlokas"". She said this first time although I had never said anything about Myself. This is how it started.
So at this stage‚ I would not like to leave your Kundalini‚ because you can cure people and curative can be done with your Kundalini even when it is in the limbic area. I am very anxious always that it should come out of the Brahmarandhra. At that stage you start getting the vibrations; but at this stage you are just a ""Chitta"" only and you just touch the ""Sat"" point. Your attention is only charmed by the Spirit. Only the attention part as I told you is like a flicker or light in a gas lamp‚ and Kundalini is like a gas which touches the spirit and the light of the spirit spreads in the central nervous system. ""Chit"" part‚ the outer core the ""Chitta"" means the attention part. At that stage the Kundalini opens the Brahmarandhra when you feel the vibrations from your hand and you can feel another person""s also; because you become ""collectively conscious"". Collectively conscious again out of Sat-Chit-Anand that you just touch the ""Chitta"" part. Thus you start feeling the Chit of your Chitta becoming the ""Chitta"" of the collective consciousness means that you drop into the ocean of Sat-Chit-Anand in which you only feel the collective consciousness.

I do not know about this thing"". So I told him this. He said that‚ ""I am in a Turiya Dasha"". I said: ""If you are in ""Turiya"" you can feel the Kundalini of another person and you cannot certify yourself like that but can you feel the Kundalini of another person?"". But he said ""no"". Then I asked him ""how can you be in Turiya?"" If you go in Turiya‚ i.e.‚ if you cross this stage‚ then you have to feel the Kundalini of another person. Now you have seen there are many people who can feel the Kundalini and they all say the same thing. They talk the same language‚ whether they do so in English‚ Indian or any other language. They say the same thing i.e.‚ this Chakra is catching or that Chakra is catching. This is because you start seeing your own Kundalini thereby seeing the Kundalini of others‚ because through the fingers you can feel what is happening. You just feel the Chitta and not the Anand part of it. First stage is through Chitta that you feel the Kundalini of another person thereby you can raise the Kundalini of another person. After a while‚ you can give Realization also to another person with the assistance of My photograph.
But the Anand stage is not yet reached. In the beginning you just feel the cold breeze in your hand. You feel peace and tranquility and also there is no thought. You feel the ""thoughtless awareness"" but the Anand part is not yet felt at this first stage. Because now I have studied thousands of human beings and their problems‚ I know; this is the fact. But there are some‚ who have reached the last stage‚ though they are very very few. Thus at the first stage when you come‚ is the ""Chit"" stage‚ the consciousness stage. You touch the ""Sat"" which means you start seeing the reality‚ is one thing you feel is flowing. At this time you start saying it is coming or it is going. Just now you said‚ it is coming. You didn""t say that ""I"" am receiving‚ I am giving. That ""I"" goes out of your language. But still the Ego and the Super Ego are not completely gone down. They are still there‚ but your attention has come up and you feel the ""Chitta"".
With this ""Collective Consciousness"" you can cure people‚ you can give them Realization as I have told you and also you can feel the Kundalini of any person in the whole world; and cure the Chakras of that person. You can tell the condition of another person far away by sitting down here. Wherever your attention goes it works thereby your attention becomes Universal. A drop of your attention becomes one with the ocean of the""Sat- Chit-Anand"".
Listen to Me carefully because many people at this stage drop out and only the attention becomes effective. I will inform you about a disciple of Mine‚ who has come here from England. One day he was sitting and thinking about his father. Suddenly he got a burning on his index finger. Hence he rang up his father. His mother told him that his condition was not good. He was suffering from a bad throat. This boy did something to his finger and his father got well. Now he might think that he is powerful and all that but he is not. He cannot think in this manner because his Sahasrara has opened up. He just said‚ ""Mother‚ I felt it and I did like this‚ and my father became all right"". He never says I did it. ""I"" goes out. You never say ""I"" did it but you will say‚ ""Mother today my Agnya is catching""‚ ""Mother my heart is catching"".
They come and speak like this about themselves. Agnya is catching means you will be going mad. But one does not feel bad about it since he is not attached to it. He is attached to his Atma. So he says‚ as an Atma this Chakra is caught or that Chakra is caught. A person‚ who is suffering from cancer‚ does not know it. But to a Realized person his attention will tell him that so and so Chakras are out of gear‚ and so many Chakras out of gear means cancer. He need not go to the doctor but he can diagnose it himself. He will not diagnose himself as the doctors do; saying you have the cancer of the heart‚ the cancer of throat etc.‚ but he will say that it is the Chakras that are caught up‚ either the left or the Right side.

Give up artificiality and be more natural. I do not mean that take out the roots and eat them or you eat the fish raw. I do not mean that. Always you must avoid going too far with the things. But try to lead a life which is more natural. Natural‚ in the sense that people know that there is no vanity about you. Some people can be the other way round. You see‚ they will dress up like a tramp‚ just to attract more attention. I mean there can be both ways. Then I find some people colouring their hair and all that. So you have to be a natural person; very natural in your behaviour. It can mean anything absurd also to some people who do not use their wisdom. Wisdom is very important in Sahaja Yoga; that you have to keep intact all the time. Natural means you must wear natural dresses‚ which are suitable to you‚ e.g. in this climate there is no use to wear dress like Rama used to wear. He will not wear anything on the top‚ there was no need. You have to wear the dress of whatever country you belong; whatever suits the occasion‚ whatever you think is dignified and good. It speaks for your more elegance and your personality. Whatever suits you‚ you should wear‚ not like all the people wearing moss colour dress‚ the great suit‚ a horrible looking and making clowns out of them. No clownish things are necessary‚ no dandy stuff is necessary. Simple‚ beautiful dresses should be worn which give you dignity.
Actually‚ in the East‚ people believe that God has given you a beautiful body and it is to be adorned with the beauty of what human beings have created‚ just to respect it‚ just to worship your body. For example in India women wear their saris‚ and saris are expressive of their moods and expression of their worship of their bodies‚ because you must respect your body. Dresses should be such that they should be for utility as well as dignity. There is no need to have uniform clothes for Sahaja Yogis at all. I don""t like it. There should be variety as nature is. Everyone should look a different person. For Puja etc. all can wear something similar‚ it doesn""t matter where your attention need not be on the variety‚ but outside‚ you should be normal person. You are all householders‚ nobody has to announce something. For you people‚ I don""t even advice to put the red mark when walking on the street. You should be normal person‚ not to be pointed out.

And when you are with children‚ you get Ganeshananda. And that can be described‚ all those can be described‚ but Niranand cannot be described‚ because it is Mahamayas"" joy. All these joys put together is Nirananda. So there is no place for ego and superego at all. The complete Sahasrara is opened out‚ and nothing but the complete rapport is established with the Divine. And there is a pouring of light all the time in the head and the light going back‚ that you have seen in my photograph‚ as if the Sahasrara becomes like a sucking child from the Universal Mother‚ sucking the joy inside‚ and it is again reflecting back. It would be like the waves reach the shores and then they are again repelled‚ they go back and then they form a pattern.
Now the joy out of that pattern‚ how can you describe? The only thing about Nirananda is that you have Mahamaya so close and so far away‚ that""s the speciality. Completely thoughtless‚ silence there; complete silence‚ you don""t think. It""s just silence you cannot put into words any more‚ because the words break with the force of the Ananda. They cannot hold it.
Alright? Now explain‚ how you are feeling‚ you better explain now.

15040,Seeking Divine Knowledge,,  ... human being was created out of amoeba or amoeba was created out of all the elements  ...," In this system‚ we have used a very wonderful system of putting five capsules one into another and the first capsule‚ the lowest one explodes and triggers the movement of the rest of four capsules. When the second one explodes‚ it gives an acceleration many more times than that with which it was already moving; the speed increases in such a tremendous way that suddenly we find that the acceleration is a very high multiple of the first one; then the third one when it explodes gives another push to the capsule. Next‚ the fourth one explodes; then the fifth one which contains the spacecraft. Through this kind of explosions from one to the other‚ through that built-in mechanism‚ we have been able to achieve a very high acceleration for the spacecraft.
In the same way our evolution has taken place. We got this idea without even knowing about our evolution from the unconscious. We have come to know how it has happened‚ but we cannot correlate both these together. So‚ in the same way human being was created out of amoeba or amoeba was created out of all the elements. In the same manner we can say that we were made again of five capsules.
The first one is the physical or physical being.
Inside the physical being was kept the emotional being.
Inside the emotional being was kept the spiritual being &
Inside the spiritual being was kept the Spirit or our attention.
We can say Kundalini is the one that triggers‚ that is the one that explodes.
So Kundalini force is in everything‚ but in the most effective‚ the best‚ the highest form‚ it is in human beings. It is this force which exists in everyone and evolves everything; say from carbon to the amoeba stage and from amoeba to animal stage and from animal to human stage. Even in elements it exists because the elements also evolve. We do not know how they evolve but it happens in nature that elements start changing their forms and mass and they become different elements. We have no idea of this because we have no way of measuring the quantity of this change that is taking place.
Then the animals also change‚ from fishes‚ many become reptiles‚ out of reptiles many become mammals‚ from mammals many become primates‚ monkeys and then human beings. All this happening takes place. How many are destroyed‚ how many remain‚ how many are transformed‚ nobody has kept any account of it.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/4556,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15050,Seeking Divine Knowledge,,The Yuga where work will be done - Krita Yuga,"""Now‚ His coming on this earth gave us the development of the Right side and so the Yagnyas were also on the Right side.
Because first of all when human beings came on this earth they were frightened of all the animals who would invade them and all kinds of horrible Rakshasas and all those people‚ and negative forces would trouble them. In that state they needed to create a king‚ a ruler‚ who was an ideal king and who would rule according to the laws of dharma. So he was the one in charge of that. He was here in Treta Yuga and Krishna came at the time of Dwapar Yuga.
When I came it was Kali Yuga but now today the time is of Krita Yuga- the Yuga where work will be done - Krita Yuga. This is the time where work will be done.
So far things have moved from one to another. Now in the Treta Yuga when Shri Rama came‚ the idea of kingship and rulership started‚ so the greatest emphasis was on the goodwill of the people. The people had to have goodwill‚ for the people and for the king‚ and for the betterment of humanity. The will: that is the Right side. So‚ how to create the goodwill? First the leader has to sacrifice and show how far he can go on sacrificing to keep the moral and the goodwill of the people.
So the Right side was created by the advent of Shri Rama because he showed a path of creating among people the awareness that they should be ruled‚ that they should not be anarchists.

15060,Seeking Divine Knowledge,,  ...in the second era now‚ we have to have compassion,"""So in the first era of Sahaja Yoga‚ we have awakened the deities in your centers‚ in the medulla oblongata and also in the brain‚ but now the time has come for us to spread it on a horizontal level‚ and to move it on the horizontal level‚ we have to understand how to go about it.
Like the seven colors of the rainbow‚ we have got seven colors of the light of these centers‚ of the Chakras‚ and when we started from the back‚ from the Mooladhara‚ bringing it up to the‚ this side‚ Agnya‚ then it is placed in a different order‚ if you see it clearly. I mean to say that in the Sahasrara‚ because it""s a concave placement‚ it""s important to understand‚ that the center of the fontanel bone area corresponds to our heart. So‚ heart is the pivotal point for the second era now. I hope you understand what I mean.
So if you have to place your attention to Sahasrara‚ first thing you have to do is to pay attention to your heart. In the Sahasrara‚ the heart-Chakra and the heart itself‚ the Atma‚ coincide. Means the Jagadamba becomes one with the heart‚ that is the Atma‚ so we see that here the yoga takes place.
At this point of time‚ it is very important to understand that we have to take a bigger step. The whole Sahasrara moves in this way‚ all these Chakras throw their lights in this way‚ in a clockwise manner and the axis is the heart. So the essence of all the religions‚ of all the prophets‚ of all the incarnations‚ is compassion‚ and is placed in this Chakra of heart. Thus we understand that in the second era now‚ we have to have compassion‚ is the manifestation now of the compassion. If God Almighty had no compassion‚ He would not have created this great universe. Actually His power‚ or the Adi Shakti‚ is the embodiment of His compassion‚ and this compassion has brought forth all the evolution to human level and even your emancipation as Sahaja yogis‚ and compassion is always completely covered with forgiveness.
So you can see the Trinity meets at this point: The Son of God is forgiveness‚ is the embodiment of forgiveness. So the God Almighty‚ who is the Witness‚ the Mother who is the compassion and the Child who is the forgiveness‚ all of them meet at heart Chakra in the Sahasrara"".",https://www.amruta.org/p/286,,,,,,,,Anahata,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15070,Seeking Divine Knowledge,,A Sahaja Yogi must have discretion if his Vishuddhi is alright," you have to surrender‚ is the pride‚ or vanity. Now the vanity can be of many types which are artificial things absolutely. Before God‚ what is your property? What is your money? What is your position? What is your family? What is your education? You see‚ everything has no value in the presence of God. The possessions that one value so much have no value. So‚ one has to realize that if we are the possessions of God‚ we should be proud of one thing only that His vibrations flow through us. That is: He is proud of us.
Like supposing you give Me a fruit or a Ganesha‚ or anything‚ it gets very much valued because I have touched it and the vibrations are there. Like this Ganesha now for example‚ if you see the value is zero as far as the metal is concerned‚ but when made into an art piece has some much more value. In this world‚ the value increases with art‚ but in the realm of God‚ or in the spiritual world or Divine world‚ the value of a Ganesha‚ the same Ganesha will be a thousand time more than what it is just now as just an art piece. So that is now what is given to you‚ a very high value. So the pride and the vanity of artificiality‚ artificial things‚ is all man-made‚ mythical‚ and should be surrendered because it is a myth.
Then the human mind has another capacity to be jealous‚ to be jealous of others. This also comes from unwise understanding. If you surrender your jealousies at the Lotus Feet of God‚ I mean‚ you are doing all rubbish actually. The stupid jealousies that you have are as you know‚ of no value‚ neither in this world‚ nor in that world. The most surprising thing is that the Sahaja Yogis feel jealous of each other! And I still can""t understand how can it be? If you are standing in the sunshine‚ then you all are jealous of your shadows! Somebody""s shadows are big‚ somebody""s shadows are small‚ so you are jealous of each other? Sometimes I give a present to one person‚ can""t give to others‚ then they get jealous! If I give more time to somebody‚ then others are jealous! I only give more time sometimes to people who really are getting lost!
So‚ one has to understand that all our ideas about jealousies are stupid. And I can""t understand those who are not Realized‚ they are jealous of Sahaja Yogis‚ and they try to make them fall! Instead of being jealous‚ they should become like Sahaja Yogis! In Sahaja Yoga also I""ve seen some very funny things happening‚ an incidence. Like a person came to Me and was very angry that ""Mother You spent so much time with a particular person‚ and I""m very jealous. And You said I have to be like the people about whom I""m jealous so I would like to know how to be like the person who was with You for such a time""? So I said ""That fellow is really a lunatic! You want to become a lunatic? Have you no discretion""? A Sahaja Yogi must have discretion if his Vishuddhi is alright. You should understand that what I""m saying is to be used discreetly‚ not blindly. So you can understand‚ without discretion‚ whatever I say‚ how funnily you can use it so detrimental to your growth. So another offshoot of ego is called as ""hot temper"". Of course it is said to be used against people who try to insult your Mother‚ you have to do that. That must be used for people who go against the Holy Ghost as Christ has said. In the same way you should not tolerate any non-sense against Me from anyone whatsoever‚ not even this much. But you can tolerate other Sahaja Yogis in other matters.",https://www.amruta.org/p/4697,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Advice,,,
15080,Seeking Divine Knowledge,,  ...your ideal in this respect‚ is Shri Krishna," The story about Him is that one day His wives wanted to go. To Him what was wives? Nothing‚ just look at it. To Him no sin can be attached. He married because He had to marry His five principles or the five elements. So He made them into women and married them. He had to marry 16‚000 women because He had to have 16‚000 powers and He had to channelize them through some bodies. So they came as women. To Him it was not a relationship of a wife‚ but a pure relationship. To Him sex had no existence at all. He was beyond it; so no question of temptations and perversions. It is out of question. The story is that once His five wives wanted to go and pray to some saint who had come - a great saint. But he really stayed across the river‚ so they wanted to go and worship him and they found a very good time when they could go and see him. So when they went near the river they said it is in spate‚ we cannot cross it‚ it""s not the time that you can cross it. So they felt it was very inauspicious‚ if they did not go and that was such an auspicious time. They wanted to go at that time and worship this guru.
So they went to Krishna and said‚ ""Now‚ how can we cross‚ the river is in spate?"" He said ""Really? Doesn""t matter. You go and tell the river - that is the river Tapi‚ they were crossing - he said go and tell the river that if we have a husband who is Shri Krishna‚ who is ""Yogeshwara""‚ that means who never indulges into any sex activity.
Yogeshwara means a person who never indulges into any sex relationships. That""s not possible. One cannot think of such a thing‚ means though He indulges‚ He never indulges‚ though He was in it‚ still He was not there. Like a lotus. If He has not indulged into any such action‚ it was only possible for Him - nobody else. That""s why He is an incarnation‚ He is not a human being. Only incarnations can do it. If some human being starts saying that I""m Shri Krishna‚ so I am doing this and I am doing that - you see‚ there are very bombastic ones‚ you must have heard about them. They do not become‚ is only an incarnation can do it. That means Yogeshwara is the one who had incarnated.
So they went and told the river ""If He is the Yogeshwara‚ then please you subside."" And she went down. So they went to the other side‚ did the Puja to the guru and they came back. Again the river was in spate and they could not cross. So they went to the guru. You see‚ the sign of a good guru or a real guru‚ is an incarnated guru‚ and they said ""See‚ we cannot cross‚ the river is in spate."" So then he said‚ ""Really‚ how did you come?"" They said‚ ""Shri Krishna asked us‚ that if I am the Yogeshwara‚ it will go down‚ you ask the question."" So he said‚ ""All right‚ now you go and ask the question‚ that if I‚ the Bhoukta‚ that means if I have eaten all the food you""ve given me‚ but I""ve not enjoyed it‚ I""ve not indulged into it‚ then let the river subside."" Then they went and told the river‚ I mean they could not believe it because they had fed him‚ that ""Whatever food we offered to him‚ if he has not eaten any food‚ then you subside"". And the river subsided!
So the moral of the whole thing is that your ideal in this respect is Shri Krishna. Not that you think you are the ideal of the rest. This is the big mistake Sahaja Yogis do. They think immediately they have become now Shri Krishna. Or they think they have become something greater or that there is an ideal that they have imbibed within themselves. It is not so.
There is one thing one has to know‚ that that is the ideal you have to reach. And your eyes should be towards that ideal and the movements should be towards that. Before that‚ if you fall into any such things like perversions and nonsensical sexual things and all that‚ you must know that you are falling down very badly. It""s a possession that is working on you. That""s an ideal - they are incarnations. You are not incarnations‚ nor can you become incarnations. But they are the light‚ which are enlightening your path‚ on which you are walking. They are taking you to the realm where they are the Kings and they are the Lords.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/2355,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Shri Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shiva and also the Devi have killed so many rakshasas. She went into wars‚ discussions and arguments. But Shri Krishna never argued‚ he knew how to get rid of them one by one. He played several tricks on them. There was an evil rakshasa who was torturing people and Shri Krishna was engaged in a war with him‚ so Shri Krishna played a trick on him. Shri Krishna entered a cave where an ascetic was sleeping. This ascetic had obtained a boon from Shiva that anyone who disturbs his sleep should turn into ashes. Shri Krishna took out his shawl‚ covered the ascetic very gently with it and hid himself. The rakshasa entered the cave and mistaking the sleeping ascetic for Shri Krishna kicked him. The ascetic got up and as he looked at him with his third eye‚ the rakshasa was burnt to ashes. This was the trick.

15110,Seeking Divine Knowledge,,  ... But actually Vishnu is the Father and He is the Son created by the Holy Ghost," In my last lectures‚ I""ve told you how Christ was created first in the heavens. In the Devi Bhagvat - if you read that - He was created as Mahavishnu and it is mentioned very clearly that first He was created as an egg. It is written in this book‚ which perhaps was written 14‚000 years back. It""s a book that predicts about Christ and that is why people in the West at Easter especially‚ offer an egg to each other as a friend.
So‚ first the existence came on this earth as an egg that was Christ and part of it was kept in that state and the rest of it was used by the Holy Ghost‚ by Mahalakshmi‚ to create Christ out of it.
In that ancient book He was called as Mahavishnu‚ means the greater form of Vishnu. But actually Vishnu is the Father and He is the Son created by the Holy Ghost. After my lecture‚ I would like‚ if you have the book‚ to read it out to them - the whole text of how Christ was created and when He was created.
He cried for His father and He cried also on the cross once‚ and He cried for years and then Christ‚ in Mahavishnu state‚ was blessed by His father who said your position will be placed higher than mine and you will be the ""Adhara"" - means the support of the universe. See how from Mooladhara He becomes the Adhara.
This was all done at the heavenly stage - ""Vaikuntha"" stage.

15120,Seeking Divine Knowledge,,Falling in love   ... a real falling happens,"""This business of falling in love‚ a real falling happens. There""s a kind of a maya of this Mahakali and you just get infatuated‚ your ego gets pampered. In these cases only two things can happen: either you can be lost completely because of your wife or your husband whom you adore and admire‚ and you""re finished‚ I mean your personality is finished‚ or else another thing‚ which is even more serious‚ is that you""ll completely break forever and hate each other. That""s why they say that there""s a love and hate relationship. How can love be hate? But it becomes because of this quality of the Goddess‚ that She is on one side an extremely loving‚ extremely kind‚ extremely soft. She goes up to a point and then She throws you on the other side. And that is why in these countries where people always fall in love   ... they cross all the maryadas also. In falling in love‚ they will marry somebody who""s already married  .... All kind of things they do. And an old woman marries a young man or an old man marries a young girl like that‚ all nonsensical things‚ without any maryadas. And they do not stick together. They have no maryadas.
To marry is to create a maryada – maryada of pure behavior. And this is the maryada which if you do not keep‚ then this Mahakali gets into it.
So first of all‚ one has to be collective  ....You have not come here to marry someone or to fall in love into something. You have not come here to get after some woman because she""s your wife or some man because he is your husband. You have had so many husbands and wives in previous lives‚ but you have come here for your ascent. And if you have come for your ascent‚ you have to keep a watch‚ how is your mind working  .... You should have a good married life‚ but not at the cost of losing your ascent.
So be careful not to get lost. You have not come here just to have only a happy married life‚ but happy married life is just one step. But if that step is taking you away from the real path of your ascent‚ it""s better to be careful.
Also we must understand that innocence means purity; purity of thought. The whole society is suffering. Society can only be pure if the family life is pure‚ not only that‚ your relations with each other are pure  ....
This bhoot of falling in love must be given up in Sahaja Yoga. That is one of the biggest loads. And one must understand that purity means chastity. Innocence means chastity – not only physical‚ also mental chastity. You have to have mental chastity. If you don""t have mental chastity‚ you cannot ascend. Actually‚ in the West it is more mental than physical‚ is a fact. If you go on mentally imagining and playing around and working it out this way‚ it""s going to be absolutely dangerous because it""s all imagination. It has nothing to do with reality. The more you get into this kind of a nonsense‚ the more you get away from reality. That never means you should be dry. It never means you should be negligent of your responsibility. Does not mean  ....
As I""ve said‚ the sap in the tree rises‚ all right? Then it purifies‚ it nourishes every part of the plant separately in a different way. Like it""s a mother‚ so mother. Father is a father. Sister is a sister. Brother is a brother. The brother-sister relations cannot become husband-wife relations. How can it be?
The sap nourishes all these things and then comes back. It doesn""t get attached to some thing‚ which is ""my wife 
Of course‚ family life has to be all right. You have to look after your family life. But that doesn""t mean that you make everything suffer. That doesn""t mean that your ascent should be finished. It cannot be that. You""re not like ordinary people. You are saints and for the saints the main thing is their ascent‚ not their family life‚ not their material possessions‚ nothing‚ nor their children‚ but their ascent. Once they ascend‚ everything will ascend with it.
Now the understanding of chastity should be there. It can come to you very easily if you ascend. It is such a vicious circle. Now first of all‚ you get your Realization‚ all right. Now you must know that Kundalini itself is the Mahakali Shakti because She""s the primordial; Mahakali Shakti is the primordial Shakti within us‚ and She remains as a virgin within you‚ which is purity. She has a power to purify. All that happens when you get your Realization. She starts manifesting Her all-beautiful aspects in you.
Now‚ the one who is sitting there is Shri Ganesha. Now people don""t understand what is innocence. Shri Ganesha is sitting there and He is the one who resides on Mooladhara‚ even over His mother‚ because He""s like a guard and He""s the one who tells whether She can ascend or not. Unless and until He gives permission‚ She cannot ascend. He stops all His work  ....
He""s only worried now about the ascent. And on every chakra He checks your purity and then‚ accordingly‚ the Kundalini tries to purify it. But when it reaches the mental level; mental level has all these funny ideas of romance  ....
In Sahaja Yoga the romance starts after the marriage‚ but also with maryadas‚ not at the cost of Sahaja Yoga‚ not at the cost of your ascent  ...
Some marriages do fail‚ the reason being they do not know what the purpose of their marriage is. So the first and foremost thing of Mahakali is that She is purity‚ absolute purity‚ and that purity‚ if we cannot imbibe within us‚ we cannot be Sahaja Yogis. Now this mind is so much conditioned‚ I know. Our children will be much better off than ourselves. They won""t have these conditionings‚ as we have had. And so many problems can be just avoided if you really become pure people  ... The wife is the one who gives the husband consolidation. Without your proper consolidation‚ into your purity‚ not into your romantic life‚ you cannot rise  ...When we are ascending‚ Shri Ganesha   ... just stops the action of excretion completely and the ascent starts.
The Deities are doing their work all right despite the fact they""ve been insulted‚ they""ve been neglected‚ we have misbehaved‚ whatever we might have done. They are doing their jobs all right. You can see it – so many people getting Realization. But what are we doing about it? We cannot be even collective. We cannot attend collective things. I look at them‚ how generous they are. They""re extremely collective   ... to such an extent if somebody‚ supposing worships Shri Krishna‚ his heart will catch. Why‚ because you must also worship Shiva. They are so collective and so much connected with Me.
So they are all collective. In the same way‚ you are also Devas‚ you also should be collective. As soon as you become collective‚ all these nonsensical things will drop out. All these ideas will drop out. You do not become collective because you have not dropped out all these things‚ or else you""re afraid of dropping them out.
So let us know what is our purpose is. Our purpose is to ascend. And what is the Mahakali power is doing for us? She""s giving you your ascent through Kundalini. She is purifying. She""s giving you all the powers. She is protecting you all the time. She is giving you joy. But what are we doing for Her? Her only‚ only desire is that My children should be saintly‚ that they should have beautiful qualities of a saint‚ that he doesn""t fall at every woman‚ fall at every man.

He learnt this from the Tibetan lamas – how to go to the supraconscious. And when he learnt it from them‚ he used it and made many people supraconscious‚ ego-oriented. You must have heard about the lama system‚ which was another big problem. They knew the future part‚ who is going to be the next lama. Where you will find him? Where you will get him? All the future things they knew and people thought this was Divine! To know future is not Divine. It is an area which we should never go to‚ because it is an imbalance. We are human beings and we have to know the ""present"" and not the ""future"". Once you go through the present stage then you reach a height from where you can see the past‚ the present and the future. Supposing on the Mother earth‚ if you have a means of going higher and hang yourself there‚ then you can see whatever has passed through‚ and you can also see what is going to come‚ and wherever you are‚ you are in the present. In the same way‚ when a person ascends in reality‚ in the present‚ he goes at this point in the supra-consciousness from where he sees the supra-conscious Right side and also he can see the subconscious; but he has no interest. He wants to rise in the present. And‚ this is what actually the Kundalini awakening is.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/563,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Terrible! Sex is not important for human beings at all! Is not at all important. It is only when you want to have children‚ actually‚ a human being who is of the highest level will indulge into sex. The lure‚ the romance‚ this nonsense and all that doesn""t exist in a pure mind‚ its all a human creation. And this servility one has to that is so much surprising.

When the sex matures‚ you become a father‚ a mother and a pure personality. When you hear about a ninety-year-old woman marrying a nineteen-year-old boy‚ I mean‚ you just don""t understand. What sort of a society has been created in this world‚ this kind of a stupid behavior? We have to mature ourselves. That doesn""t mean I""m saying austerity at a young age. That doesn""t mean that. Another absurdity is that. But of course you must mature. You need a tapasya for that.
The unimportant thing when it becomes important; and such an unimportant thing‚ that it""s just like anything that we have‚ like we have hair. Even if we lose hair‚ it means something. But if we lose sex‚ what""s wrong with it? It""s very good. Good riddance to bad rubbish. Such a waste of energy. So much interest‚ so much of our precious attention‚ so much of auspiciousness spent in this kind of a nonsensical thing.
So‚ to worship Ganesha one has to understand we have to mature. Maturity has to come within us. We have to go deeper within ourselves. Our attention has to go deeper within ourselves‚ spontaneously. How do we achieve the depth if we are still like worms? Otherwise it""s a great sort of a sacrifice‚ or a pressure on people.

When you see cities‚ any beautiful picture or scene‚ immediately what you find is a great flow of Ananda coming down. This is the Grace that you are just lost into it; like the Ganges flowing over you‚ you are completely drowned into it. Your consciousness becomes Anand.
In reality you come to know that till now we have never known there is a ""Sarvavyapi Shakti"" but now we are aware of the same. We can feel it coming in our fingers. This is the Reality. There is Chaitanya all around us‚ which thinks‚ which understands‚ organizes and loves us. All this you come to know the knowledge part of it. Then the Anand which is the Hrudaya starts emitting it. Later on what you get is Vilaya into Ananda. At that stage complete Self Realization takes place. At that stage you can control the sun‚ you can control the moon‚ you can control every element.
Beyond that there is ""God""s Realization"". There are three stages to that also‚ but just now I have told about this. ""Sat-Chit-Anand"" state. The ""God""s Realization"" is the stage which‚ Gautam Buddha and Mahavira only had achieved and settled down in our brain. Christ is also here. These two are not incarnations. They are born as Human beings. They were born to Sita‚ as Lava and Kusha. Then they were born as Buddha and Mahavira and ""Adi Shakti"" was their Mother once again. Later on they were born to ""Fatimabi"" as Hasan and Hussein.
They are the two milestones you have got‚ by which you can know to what height a human being can rise. Now today they are like incarnations. There are other styles of personalities like Chiranjivas‚ Bhairava‚ Ganesha. They are all incarnations. Hanuman later on appeared as ""Gabriel the Angel"". ""Bhairavnath"" came as Saint Michael. The names are different‚ but they are the same personalities. Devi has also incarnated. There is no doubt about it. The scientist will not understand this but a Sahaja Yogi can. Because they can immediately feel their vibrations and can ask questions. You can ask questions about Me also and you will get the vibrations. For that at least your Deities have to rise and say ""Yes"".

You are their responsibility. All the ""Deities"" are awakened in you. If you do anything against the ""Deities"" immediately they will harm you. A person who has got Realization‚ goes to a place which is not to be seen or which is not to be felt or which is not a good place‚ or to a fake Guru; immediately he will feel heated up. If he does not run away‚ and if he still goes on and on he will lose his vibrations and he will become like another ordinary person.
Initially it is in a very transitory stage. Still‚ I would say at this point that the repulsion is not so very great that the man does not accept it. Because if you accept it‚ you become completely Realized. If you do not accept it‚ then there might be a little bodily problem that you might have. You might harm your own fingers‚ or you might get little burning sensation here or there. But if you are not afraid of these bodily sensations and if you ignore them‚ then you start rising higher and higher and I have already informed you that all the ""Chiranjivas"" start guiding you and looking after you.
If there is one Realized person in the train‚ there cannot be an accident and if there is an accident‚ nobody will die in that train.

15190,Seeking Divine Knowledge,,  ... when Vishnu becomes the Virata‚ the great primordial being‚ then She is called as Viratangana‚ as His power,"""Now when this desire becomes evident in human beings‚ then only Lakshmi incarnates as Mahalakshmi.
So She incarnated as Mahalakshmi when Rama came on this earth‚ first time. And also She incarnated as Radha when Sri Krishna came on this earth. And when She came as Mary‚ it was Mahalakshmi who bore the child that is Lord Jesus Christ. So the child She bore was the great personality of Mahavishnu. This Mahavishnu-tattwa is also represented‚ or we can say has an aspect‚ of others‚ which incarnated on this earth as two children of Sita. They incarnated as Mahavira and Buddha‚ as Hassan and Hussein.
Also at the time of the prophets Mahalakshmi incarnates as a pure relationship with them. Like Raja Janaka""s daughter was Janaki‚ means Sita; then She came on this earth as the daughter of Mohammed Sahib; and then She came on this earth as Nanaki‚ the sister of Nanaka. So She resides as a pure relationship of these gurus.
Thus the Mahalakshmi""s greatness is that‚ through Her power only the Sushumna is covered by Kundalini. She is the power of our evolution. And by Her power only we have risen to be human beings and by Her son""s power we are going to become higher people. Thus the importance of Mahalakshmi is very great for all the Sahaja Yogis. Because She guides our Vishnu tattwa to its culmination‚ to its completion. Which is the principle of our evolution. Thus She is a giver of Dharma‚ She gives us the Dharma and She is the giver of the truth. She is the one who relates us to our brain - the whole brain is Mahalakshmi""s system. So it is She who exposes the whole of the knowledge as truth to us‚ on our central nervous system. But at the state of Virata‚ when Vishnu becomes the Virata‚ the great primordial being‚ then She is called as Viratangana‚ as His power.
So these are the incarnations of Mahalakshmi about which I have told. There""s so much can be said about this Mahalakshmi-tattwa; you are all blessed much by that.
And so today we remember Her great incarnation as Maria‚ who was very great because She had to bear terrible pain in Her heart with all Her powers that She had. She was a tremendously powerful Lady. But despite that‚ She bore all the tortures of Christ upon Her heart. And it was Her order and Her desire that Christ had to crucify Himself so that people could be resurrected. And sometimes Indians asked me what did She do to be a Mahalakshmi‚ what did She achieve? I said‚ """"with all Her powers to bear it. To play the drama it must be too much.""""
So She is the redeemer and She connects you to God. In the sense She is the bridge. And the Kundalini rises over the bridge. And Kundalini is the Mahakali. Now we have a temple in India which you have visited of Mahalakshmi in Kolhapur; and there when they sing‚ when they worship Mahalakshmi at that time they say ""ude‚ ude‚ Ambe"". That time they say ""Oh Ambe - the Kundalini - rise"".
But Kundalini is the potential of all the three powers: Mahakali‚ Mahalakshmi‚ Mahasaraswati‚ because it is the primordial desire. Because She is the Holy Ghost‚ you see‚ so She contains all these three powers in it.

And then you start seeing things which are connected with your subconscious or your collective subconscious and all this thing. And you may go onto supraconscious side where you see your future and all this thing. But the reason why you get dreams actually is that the unconscious‚ which is within you‚ or you can say the Kundalini or your Atma is trying to guide you to the right path. And how does it guide you to the right path? Is through dreams. But these are misunderstood.
How do you understand these dreams because you are so confused. First you go deep into yourself and you touch the unconscious - sushuptistithi. But from there you come out. And then when you are coming out‚ you touch your subconscious or maybe supraconscious. So whatever anubhuti you had‚ or whatever experience you had‚ of the depths of the sushupti gets confused and you don""t know what you dreamt‚ and you don""t understand and you forget it. But those who are realized souls go to their sushupti and see exactly what they have to know. Like many people in Bombay when I came‚ they didn""t know I was coming but they were at the airport because they got the dream. So at this sushupti level‚ at the deep level you get the communication with God if you know how to go in and come out fully aware.

He also said very clearly how he treated some patients with this understanding that there was a lady who came to see him‚ and the daughter was with her.
And she said that‚ ""I always dream‚"" the daughter said‚ ""that my mother is a witch while my mother is very kind to me‚ I don""t know how to understand this dream that says that my mother is a witch‚ and she is just [draining?] me?""
So he studied her and he asked the mother‚ ""Do you spoil your daughter very much?""
She said‚ ""Yes‚ I give her lots of money‚ and I give her everything‚ and I give her all the freedom‚ and I say‚ ""Do what you like with yourself""‚ I""m not bothered about her.""
And the daughter was very young about 15 years of age. So the unconscious was giving the warning to the daughter say that‚ ""Do not take to these things‚ be careful. If she""s spoiling you‚ be careful.""
Then another dream‚ just to match with it‚ he said‚ ""There was a gentleman who always saw in his dream that he""s bowing to his son‚ all the time bowing to his son."" And like a king the son was sitting‚ and he was just going and bowing to him.""
So he came to him and told him‚ ""I don""t know why I get such a dream.""
He said‚ ""What is your relation with your son?""
He said‚ ""The son is just‚ I would say because he was born to my first wife‚ and my second wife is against him‚ and that""s not good relationship‚ and you see I cannot afford to be very friendly with him.‚"" and all sorts of things he‚ the relationship was not so good.
So then he said‚ ""That""s the thing that your son is very much liked by God. He is a saint. He is a good person. And why you are troubling him? So the unconscious giving you all the time the information that you just don""t do that.""
And that""s how he calculated what kind of a symbol expresses what. And it was amazing‚ though he got his realization very late in life‚ the way he discovered that there is universal unconscious.
This universal unconscious is nothing but this all-pervading power. Now it is unconscious‚ means it is not in our central nervous system. We are not conscious of it. So we have to be conscious of it. How do we get conscious of it is that‚ first we have to get connected to our Spirit because spirit is the expression of that universal unconscious within us or you can say the link. Unless and until you get your Self-Realization you cannot be linked‚ you cannot be linked with this universal power which is within us as Kundalini and which is without all over.
It is most surprising to understand that God who has created us with such care with such love‚ especially as a human being which is the most beautiful thing God has created. We may or may not think so. We may not. We may have self-pity; we may have guilt‚ all these nonsensical ideas. But you don""t know. You""re special thing that God has created. And on top of that the highest human being are not these politicians‚ or these great successes‚ and geniuses‚ and all that but who? These are the seekers because they have to enter into the kingdom of God. It is their right first to enter into the kingdom of God. They are a very‚ very special category. And this is very well described by a great poet William Blake‚ who says that these are men of God. And he described the modern times and Sahaja Yoga very well.
He says‚ ""These men of God will be born in those days‚ and they will become prophets‚ and they will have powers to make others prophets."" And that""s the thing he said.",https://www.amruta.org/p/4580,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15340,Subtle system cleansing‚ enlightenment and the techniques for ascent,,Fanaticism is against SahajaYoga,"Fanaticism is against Sahaja Yoga - absolutely. Now they will ask‚
""How many times we should say this ""Mantra""?"" Then I say‚ ""Zero times.""
""How many drops we should put‚ the ghee‚ in our nose?"" Then I say‚ ""A full jug."" Then‚ ""Oh‚ I should not have gone from the Left side‚ I should ave gone from the Right side."" Then‚ I would say‚ ""You just jump up.""
You have to be like children. But the ideas are so settled down in Sahaja Yoga‚ now it""s so many years of course‚ but they should not settle down. If they settle down‚ it""s not Sahaja; it""s not spontaneous. ""If you do this way‚ then it is wrong; that way‚ it""s wrong"" – nothing of the kind. Nothing is wrong for you people. If you do anything wrong‚ your vibrations will be lost‚ finished. What is there to be so cautious? Like‚ somebody said‚ ""I don""t want to look at the cigarette."" I said‚ ""Why?""
""Looking at it also is sinful.""
I said‚ ""Looking at it what happens?""
""Then I feel like smoking.""
So I said‚ ""Better smoke once for all.""
Or‚ ""I cannot hold a wine bottle in my hand."" ""Why?""
""No‚ holding the wine bottle is sinful.""
I mean‚ you can swim in the wine. So this kind of understanding should be there. Though I have always said that if I say one thing‚ you will clinch on to it. So I always say the other side of it - that don""t stick on to something; Sahaja Yoga is not for sticking on to something. Like somebody who had learnt certain say‚ lessons about Sahaja Yoga in the beginning of it‚ certain Mantras they had learnt‚ and still they are sticking on to the same step. No‚ no‚ no‚ no – you have to go ahead. This is just a staircase. Don""t get stuck at a point. We have had so many such cases here. People get really outworn as they say. They will go on telling you so many nonsensical ideas – ""You see‚ if you do like this‚ then this happens."" First of all‚ you don""t give ideas to others. That""s one thing - if you decide that we don""t give ideas about what""s wrong with another person‚ half of your job is done. Because you don""t have to do any job‚ as I don""t do. Anybody who comes‚ ""You are a ""bhoot""."" You better have it. I get reports from others. They say that your Sahaja Yogis are wicked people. I said‚ ""Why?""
""Oh‚ they tell you‚ ""You are evil."" They tell you‚ ""You are possessed""‚ they tell you‚ ""You are this‚ you are that""; they are very wicked people.""
I am really shocked to hear that Sahaja Yogis - how can they be wicked? If somebody is suffering from something‚ in the phone they say‚ ""Oh you better have it. It""s good for you."" That""s not the way. We have to be not only humble‚ very tactful and sweet to new people – if you want any more to come in. But if you have decided not to have anymore‚ because you will have to put another marquee‚ then I have nothing to say. But if you want others to come in‚ then it""s important that you talk to them in a very sweet and beautiful language‚ the way they understand. Rudeness‚ arrogance‚ showing off‚ is of no use. One should understand Sahaja Yoga is where you are in complete enjoyment about it; you are just lost into that enjoyment. Where is the time to remember how many times to give a ""Bandhan"" to yourself? What is the need to give ""Bandhan"" to yourself? It""s all a joke now for you‚ should be. A little child sucks the milk from the bottle‚ all right‚ because it has no teeth. But what about you people having that kind of a thing? It""s very childish and shows no growth at all. Sahaja Yoga must grow within. You should not be‚ anymore‚ regarded as immature Sahaja Yogis. I would say: a person who is a matured Sahaja Yogi is the one who can combine so many things together‚ with all beautiful lines‚ thin lines‚ thin ""Maryadas"" [Hindi/Sanskrit meaning code of conduct] maintained.

15350,Subtle system cleansing‚ enlightenment and the techniques for ascent,https://youtu.be/4UMIbNZakfo,By pulling that backwards they started developing their pituitary‚ and this pituitary was activated,"Today is very interesting topic before us‚ is to discuss the Vishuddhi chakra‚ which is placed here behind the base of the neck‚ and which has got sixteen petals. It manifests outside the cervical plexus in the gross or physical action. As you know‚ for the emotional side you have got ductless glands and thyroid is the gland which is placed here. This center in the evolution is of greatest importance for human beings‚ because this center developed its maximum growth when human beings raised their hands‚ heads from animal stage to become human beings. For animals the heads were at an angle towards the ground‚ first it was just touching‚ parallel‚ then it was raised higher and higher till it came to monkey stage where it was raised slightly higher and at the human stage only they raised their hands‚ heads in a straight line. Straight line was all right. In the straight line it was the balance between the superego and the ego. First there is superego in the animals when they are looked after by human beings. Animals developed certain conditionings from human beings. Like a dog has to be looked after by human beings. Then the dog is told to do this or that and the conditioning starts. And when this conditioning starts in a dog‚ he starts developing his superego in a human way. But when a chimpanzee raised his head and tried to become a man‚ first the head of the first original man was bent like this. In the Ramayana‚ there is a mention of such race‚ the missing race‚ where human beings were half monkeys and half human beings. That""s about eight thousand years back.
Now this center was really‚ fully enlightened by Shri Krishna‚ who came on this earth in the era called as Dwapara. Rama was in Satyayuga‚ and He came in Dwapara. That is about six thousand years back. And Shri Krishna incarnated as one of the incarnations of Shri Vishnu‚ who is responsible for our evolutionary process. It is only through Shri Vishnu that we evolve. He is the aspect which gives us dharma. Dharma is our sustenance. Through changing our sustenance or our capacities we have evolved. Like I can say Carbon was at Mooladhara chakra. And this Carbon [?] matter got prana into it by which it started moving as a living thing. This living thing then grew into higher and higher awareness till it reached a stage where you were an animal and then you had to become a human being. The first human beings were short people. That incarnation of the short people is called as Vamana. Then there were people who became very conscious of the nature around and wanted to have the mastery over the nature. They started doing all kinds of yagnyas according to the Vedas. Vedas actually worked out right hand side growth of human beings. And they developed people who were good at reciting Veda mantras and all such things that would give us mastery over the five elements. These people when they mastered the five elements they became very ego oriented‚ and instead of only keeping the head in the center they started pulling it backwards. By pulling that backwards they started developing their pituitary‚ and this pituitary was activated so much that they increased their [?] than normal‚ became [?] people‚ started thinking about the future and the idea of future started coming into the human beings.",https://www.amruta.org/p/6775,,,,,,,,Mooladhara,,,,,,Shri Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15360,Subtle system cleansing‚ enlightenment and the techniques for ascent,,Question: Please‚ I have a question. I am practicing yoga and work with my chakras‚ but my thyroid gland is not working.,"Shri Mataji : Which yoga are you practicing?
Question :   ...it""s from Indian medicine men from the native people of America  ...and it""s yoga  ...
Shri Mataji : I will tell you. This lady is telling Me that she""s practicing some sort of a yoga‚ but her thyroid is not curable. About all these yogas I have to tell you the same thing. Without getting the Realization‚ without getting the connections with the mains‚ if you take to any one of these methods‚ even what you call that Chinese thing‚ Tai Chi‚ and another thing they put the pins and needles‚ acupuncture‚ any one of these things‚ then you exhaust the energy of a particular center to the maximum. Then this center sucks in from other centers. Because there is no unlimited source within us. So doing all these things puts you on to the sympathetic nervous system. Even cancer is caused by the over-activity of the sympathetic. So it is the case just like a car which has got limited petrol and you can go to that extent and no further. But if you go too further with it‚ you ruin the car completely. But when you are connected with the mains‚ all the time the vital force is flowing through you. So first you must get connected to the mains‚ which is yoga itself. Without the connection how do they call it yoga‚ I don""t understand. There is no union and they call it yoga. Also yoga means the deftness in the maneuvering of the Divine power. If the Kundalini has not risen how will you know where it is obstructed? Now supposing if you start from here to go to your house‚ how can you know where is going to be the obstruction? But here the car has not yet started. And you are trying to correct the obstructions at a point which does not exist‚ may exist. So all these yogas have no meaning because there is no connection with the Divine‚ with the main. Supposing this instrument is not connected to the mains‚ it is useless. If you telephone to somebody without connection‚ you""ll break the telephone. So the first thing one has to do is to connect you to that Divine power. Is it not logical?
In the olden days‚ when this Patanjali yoga was practiced thousands of years back‚ the first thing was called as IshwaraPraridhan means the establishment of God within you. So now‚ but in the modern times everything is so confused (Shri Mataji laughing) that a simple thing like this we overlook. If you get cured it is just a by-product. Just as the by-product of these lights is that we walk properly. All right now.",https://www.amruta.org/p/6793,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have many children in this country who are born Realized. And I have met some human beings also who are born Realized‚ but they are rather difficult people‚ I don""t know why. Though they are born Realized‚ they get possessed by their egos sometimes and they are not that evolved as they should be and they start behaving very queer‚ in a very queer manner. And their behaviour can be sometimes so shocking‚ that it""s most surprising and they mesmerize people and they take to all these things to assert their influence on other people. It is a very surprising thing that those who did not get Realization through SahajYog‚ or who were born Realized‚ have not been able to express themselves‚ sometimes‚ and then they felt that they had a knowledge which was not complete about it. And they felt they were different‚ and they tried to assert on others their ways and methods‚ by learning mesmerism and things like that. It""s most surprising but we have someone here already who is a Realized soul‚ who is here‚ who was possessed‚ who came here‚ got cured and she""s all right now. So even if you are Realized you can be possessed.
But in Sahaj Yoga‚ the advantage is‚ after Realization‚ you know all the techniques by which – techniques of the Divine Force‚ which is flowing through you. That means when you have to have the energy‚ you have to put to the mains. But once you get the energy in you‚ you should know how to maneuver it. Then you know how to protect yourself‚ you know how to improve yourself‚ how to cure others‚ how to give Realization to others‚ how to awaken others‚ and everything you know‚ all the secrets‚ and the most secret-most techniques of the Divine Force‚ are told to you.

At that time you must be very careful as to their training.
From the first five years all the parents must be extremely strict with children‚ extremely strict. Don""t allow them to overpower you or manipulate you. It""s very important.

15390,Subtle system cleansing‚ enlightenment and the techniques for ascent,,SahajaYoga is against the rituals," The moment you ""try"" to take the ego out of the mind‚ automatically the mind and also the ego start developing more. ""Aham Karoti Sahamkara"" I will do it! It means even if we ""try"" to reduce our ego by any means‚ it will keep on increasing - as ""trying"" is also an action that is enacted by our ego only. People think that he can manage to bring down his ego by becoming strict with himself for example‚ consuming little food and things like that. The entire stupidity of the world is either standing on one foot or with head upside down. People are always trying to adopt various techniques to put down his ""ego"". But‚ with all these acts‚ the ego does not come down‚ instead it develops. Observing fast or practicing all sorts of meditation or penances‚ one develops his ego only. Havana also helps adding to this ego‚ as the fire element is placed on the Right side. Practice of these acts or the rituals‚ help this ego to develop. And people think that whatever they are doing are alright.
For‚ thousands of years man has been practicing exactly all those rituals that have been taught to him- he is carrying out all those wrong practices till today that he has been asked to do. For this reason Sahaja Yoga is against the rituals. You do not have to practice any rituals for that matter and go to the extremes of it. It is even worse. For example‚ as I was telling you the other day‚ that the best way to take out your ego is to‚ - as they say in Marathi ""Jodepatti""‚ - you must shoebeat it. So‚ everyday in the morning the Sahaja Yogis started coming out on the road in a queue with shoes in hand. Well‚ it is to be done only when you have ego within you and not otherwise. Every other individual was seen walking on the road with their shoes in hand. This sort of ritualism has very much permeated inside Sahaja Yoga. It has gone to such extreme that a gentleman‚ from France had brought all kinds of rituals with him and claimed that he had brought them from the Vashi Hospital. Well‚ you must know that these (rituals) are meant for the sick people. Only if you are sick‚ then you can practice these rituals. He had even written down some of those rituals that were meant for the Cancer patients. As I told you the human being are in habit of practicing all rituals. Because‚ he always think ""I can do it""‚ and that everything is going to work out fine for him with all these rituals. It""s not only with you people‚ who have been doing all these kind of rituals. In the western countries also you find people have taken to practicing these rituals in a variety of styles  ...""",https://www.amruta.org/p/4167,,About meditation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15400,Subtle system cleansing‚ enlightenment and the techniques for ascent,,  ...the whole life style is ritualistic. There is no freedom," At that time Shri Krishna came. His own cousin was a Tirthankara‚ you""ll be surprised‚ He became a Tirthankara and that made Shri Krishna think about it‚ that this kind of stupid ritualism that we have – like in the morning women will get up‚ in their sleep they will go put some water for tulsi‚ do this thing‚ that thing‚ throw water here and there‚ and also the untouchables and touchables‚ and you can""t take water from this‚ you can""t eat this‚ you can""t move like that; all kinds of restrictions‚ timing‚ everything. This time is not good‚ that time is not good‚ this you should not do‚ that you should not do  ... to such an extent that the whole movement of our country was around these rituals.
I had nephews who used to come to Bombay for their work. Every day  ... time they went to Lucknow‚ they would come with shaven heads. I""d say‚ ""What""s the matter?"" He said‚ ""There are many people in our family who are old and when they die we have to shave our heads."" So every time they went there somebody died so they came with shaven heads. Like that‚ such horrible rituals existed and even now in the South India‚ there is a lot of rituals are there‚ terrible rituals‚ and they cannot get out of it; they""re frightened. If they get out of it then they might be sinners‚ or they will go to hell.
So the Indian conditioning was‚ as far as these rigidities were concerned for religion‚ to be on the Right side‚ to be on the  ... in such a way that we should not be caught up without doing this. So early in the morning they will get up and do the rituals just without even thinking about what they""re doing. But in the West‚ the lifestyle is nothing but rigidity‚ the whole lifestyle; there""s no freedom anywhere. And all that then was rewarded by these hippies and other people and all of them‚ and they fought it and that thing went to another extremes. So‚ from one extreme to another extreme they went.
Now how Shri Krishna""s advent changed it. When Shri Krishna came on this earth‚ He said this is all a leela. It is just a play. Because you""re involved into it you cannot see the play. But‚ if you ascend – if you are in the water you are afraid of the water‚ but if you get into the boat you can see the water and if you know how to swim you can even save the people who are in the water. So He says that if you develop a witness state‚ sakshi swarupa‚ if you develop that state then you see the whole thing as a drama. Nothing affects you‚ nothing matters‚ you don""t worry about anything‚ you see the problem above‚ you are and you see the problem and because you are‚ out of it you can solve the problem. This was His great advent‚ I would say‚ that has taught the first step towards the ascent is that you have to become a sakshi. You have to become the witness  ...  ....
Now‚ let""s see in Sahaja Yoga. In Sahaja Yoga there are different types of people come from different areas‚ from different cultures‚ because the door is open to everyone. Now‚ if an Indian comes in‚ he will be all the time watchful about others and will say that‚ ""Mother this man is not doing this‚ this man is not doing that. He should have done foot-soaking."" He""ll find faults with others‚ all the time saying that this man is not doing like this and you know. But in the West they start finding faults with them. And I receive letters‚ ten to twelve pages sometimes‚ confessing what wrong they have done. Who is interested to know what wrongs you have done? I mean if a lotus is born nobody wants to know how many filthy things are inside the pond. You are now a lotus‚ but it""s so common that they think we must confess‚ we must tell Mother what wrong we have done. Every moment you are changing‚ so what is there to confess?

Puja is a thing‚ but is how to overcome our material grossness. When we want to have a ""matter"" to ourselves we must know that it is given to us by God. Everything belongs to God.
Supposing we give flowers to God‚ after all it is God""s own creation‚ what are we giving? We show light to God or do ""Arti"" to God. What? It""s God""s light only. What do we do? But‚ by showing light to God‚ what we do is to worship light within us. The light element gets enlightened within us. The light element is here on the Agnya. When you do ""Arti"" or when you put light before God‚ when you show light to God‚ the light element within you gets enlightened.
When you give flowers‚ ""Mooladhara"" gets enlightened. When you give honey‚ then your attention gets enlightened. So‚ why we give it to God? After all God does not need anything. But God is the Enjoyer. You are not the enjoyer. You can not enjoy. Enjoyer is God in you‚ when God is there‚ that enjoys‚ that is the Spirit. So‚ whatever pleases your Spirit is used in the Puja to be given. Now you give rice‚ all these things are discovered‚ that you give rice to the Devi; rice should be put in Her lap. Now‚ what is rice‚ a little rice to Devi? By putting rice‚ in you the satisfaction of getting food or food that gives you satisfaction is enlightened. But that does not mean you start showering things on Me. That does not mean that. What I am trying to say do it with dignity and understanding. That you give Me rice. Now‚ rice giving is‚ people don""t understand why rice is to be given to God? After all‚ why give Him palm leaves? What is He going to do? If Christ was the son of God‚ what was the use of putting palm leaves for Him or to give Him oil? Ah  ...Oil bath or to rub His feet with oil? It is for you to get the advantage.
Now in Sahaja Yoga‚ it is proved now‚ when you rub My Feet you feel better‚ not Me. You rub My hands‚ you feel better. When you fall at My Feet‚ you feel better. She is a great (pointing to a Sahaja Yogini) What were you doing  ...ah  ...reflexology  ...big name  ...reflexology  ...and she is supposed to know about the feet and things like that  ... One day she said‚ Mother‚ I want to come and massage Your feet. I know this and that. I said alright‚ come along. So she came to rub My Feet. Instead of I becoming relaxed‚ she was becoming relaxed‚ the more she was rubbing‚ she was getting relaxed. So‚ you see when you do for God‚ the blessings come to you. You are blessed.
Whatever is the problem with you‚ you give to God to solve. Also‚ whatever satisfies you‚ you give to God. The satisfaction comes to you. Now these flowers‚ when you give it to Me; Mooladhara  ...They give you two things- Swadhishthana and Mooladhara. Flowers‚ that""s why‚ are very important. They give Swadhishthana; if the flowers are beautiful then they give Swadhishthana. If they are fragrant‚ they cure your Mooladhara. Now I mean there is no end to flowers also.
But‚ think about it‚ that you are doing it to improve your Chakras. Then other things that are used like say Ghee. Ghee is used. It is for   ...Shri Krishna is very fond of ghee and butter. So when you rub My Feet with say butter‚ your Vishuddhi will improve. You know that. Not Mine. I have no problem. I have only one problem that you are within Me. When you have problem I have problem. Because‚ these vibrations have to go to you‚ so I prepare these vibrations here as an antidote and they have to flow.
It is a very subtle thing to understand. To move from gross to Spirit; this is the thing by which you move‚ because‚ first you enlighten your Chakras. By enlightening your Chakras your deities are happy ""Prasanna"". By making the deities happy you keep- get a passage for the Kundalini to pass through. By making the passage for the Kundalini‚ the Kundalini goes up and then your attention starts becoming one with the Spirit.

You have gone that way. So the rule of the road is to be understood. That is the one that comes to us called Pramada. After that we have another inherent problem. It is called as ""Bhrama-darshan"" (hallucinations). We start seeing hallucinations‚ especially people who take LSD and all such things. They do not see Me. Sometimes they just see light or any such hallucination of the future or of the past. They may see Me as something else. If you see Me in dreams it is alright or see something in dreams it is alright. But if you start seeing something that""s called Bhrama Darshan‚ ""Bhrama"" means illusion‚ then you start developing illusions. The worst part of it is that people start telling lies about it. I know about everyone. When this Bhrama Darshan starts it is the most dangerous thing for vibrations also.
Some people are absolutely cocksure about themselves. I see that. And they tell the whole world‚ they will dominate everybody saying that vibrations of this thing are not good; the vibrations of that thing are not good while they have no mastery over it. Now I have to be very careful. I cannot talk like a teacher. So I say alright‚ give yourself a bandhan and put your hands towards Me and see for yourself and all that.
If they by any chance know that I have found that they are lying‚ then they are finished. I must keep their falsehood to me. You see I am very careful because I know they are on a very slippery ground. So even if I mention in a way that is not so blunt still it might happen to be blunt for them. But one must know that it is for the good that we have to stick onto our truth. And we should not be led away by our own ideas about ourselves.
Then another thing that comes is ""Vishaya Chitta"" in which the attention is attracted by objects of your previous identifications where your attention has been. You are say fond of cricket. Alright‚ you are but you should not be a sick person. I mean cricket does not mean that you become a cricket bat. And you are good for nothing‚ for anything else and for all practical purposes you are dead.

15590,Subtle system cleansing‚ enlightenment and the techniques for ascent,,But in collectivity Krishna principle‚ plus the principle of the guru‚ is mixed.," Now another thing you have to do is to put your fingers into your ears and say ""Allah-Hu-Akbar"" sixteen times. Put your head back. It will clear out most of your problems about Vishuddhi. Mantras are to give strength to your Deities. Of course‚ Deities are very powerful‚ but strength‚ meaning the vehicle‚ which is carrying the Deity‚ becomes stronger. As you know‚ is also the mantra of Radha-Krishna or Vitthala is the same for right Vishuddhi; but ""Allah-hu-Akbar"" has two things in it. First is of course‚ the Vishuddhi and also the collectivity. So by the first one‚ you get bad colds and you get your attention diverted and other problems of the ear‚ nose‚ throat. And by the second one when it is spoiled‚ you say aggressive words‚ sarcastic language‚ all kinds of things that breaks the collectivity. So‚ either you suffer from a bad cold‚ so you cannot speak‚ and when you speak you hurt others. But the voice should be melodious and the language should be controlled. If we can control our tongue‚ eighty percent of collectivity we""ll achieve. Tongue is first of all‚ of course‚ for saying things which are sweet and beautiful. Let us find out what sweet things we are going to say to people who come here. Not expressing our views about‚ I like it‚ I like that‚ I want that‚ but on the contrary‚ ""do you like this‚ do you like this‚ would you enjoy this?"" So the language should be directed towards others‚ showing interest and concern.
Another thing one should try is a physical treatment of your throat‚ it is very simple‚ I""ve seen is that‚ you push back your tongue‚ and put‚ this is a physical thing‚ put your chin here and try to push back your tongue as much as possible‚ now‚ and hold your breath‚ push back your tongue as much as you can. Kundalini will move further. First you have done Allah-hu-Akbar‚ so you have bent backwards. By doing this‚ you see‚ you have allowed it to open the other way round. You will see the sides; from the sides the Kundalini will be opened out.
Another thing is that‚ Krishna is very fond of butter. But in collectivity Krishna principle‚ plus the principle of the guru‚ is mixed. When he becomes the guru‚ then the collectivity starts. When these two get integrated‚ then the collectivity starts and as a result of that‚ you get discretion. So to improve the discretion part‚ is a very simple thing we do is to take vibrated ghee or butter‚ which is heated up‚ and put it in the nose. But before that‚ we gargle our throat with the salt‚ which represents the guru principle. Also you can take a little ghee or butter on top of a hot water cup and if you drink it that soothes all your sides because that is‚ Krishna is soothed by that.
There""s another thing called primrose oil‚ that you get in this country‚ primrose oil‚ two‚ three drops of that if you can take it in the water that will also soothe your Vishuddhi. So oil is the one that helps you. In your ears‚ if you can‚ put some olive oil heated up with some garlic in it‚ heated up; one garlic piece in it‚ that""s very good for the ears. So the oil is the one that keeps your Vishuddhi alright. Also the hair are to be oiled properly. A lot of oil should be used before‚ say Saturday or something‚ so that when you have your bath you clear out your oil completely. And when you get conditioners here‚ is a good idea‚ but in India we use oil again‚ but you can use conditioners if you want‚ but make the hair smooth with it. And then you must do again‚ with your own hands‚ a nice massage or one Sahaja Yogi can do for another.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/387,,,,Treatments,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of course‚ there is truth in it‚ no doubt‚ we have seen how a candle‚ how a candle tells you as to what is your position inside‚ if you are possessed or if you are not. A candle can tell you‚ can you imagine? Candle is so much knowledgeable. Supposing you have a heart‚ heart-trouble‚ the candle will show! And if you treat yourself with a candle you can cure yourself! So it is so sensitive‚ not that it can cure‚ but also so competent‚ not that it shows you that you are sick and you have problems but that it is competent to cure.
That""s why in India‚ Agni was worshipped‚ light was worshipped‚ the fire was worshipped. That was worshipped. They must have discovered that the fire knows everything. So the inner‚ inner awareness of all these elements‚ they knew about it and that""s why they worshipped those elements.

Without the Left side‚ Right side is very dangerous. If you don""t have Right side‚ of course it""s a big dangerous thing also. But‚ first you must have development of your Left side. That is what‚ to begin with‚ we had in Sahaja Yoga. Left side is compassion‚ is love‚ universal feeling. All we can say is the blessings of the Devi which are described you know as‚ in the Devi Mahatmyan‚ that the Goddess resides within you as so many things. She resides in you as Shraddha‚ as She resides in you as sleep. She resides in you as illusion‚ Bhranti. All kinds of things are there on the left-hand side‚ which are already described and when I told you about Sahaja Yoga‚ I wanted to make your Left side very strong. Those who‚ people who took to Right side‚ become very aggressive people and they had mastered the essence of these five elements‚ that""s alright‚ but they were extremely hot tempered‚ so much so that they used to curse people‚ curse them. They used to say things which were not kind and they didn""t believe in the universality. It was such a dangerous thing that they took.
In Indian Shastras you can see many incidents where people gave a curse‚ shout‚ very common. All these gurus used to curse a person‚ because they had no compassion‚ no love‚ nothing but their powers of the Right side. We have seen now that those people who have Right side‚ who go only on the Right side without the Bhakti‚ without the blessings of the Divine‚ can become rakshasas actually‚ can become a great danger for humanity.

15640,Subtle system cleansing‚ enlightenment and the techniques for ascent,,  ...this is the mantra of the Agnya Chakra in front and at the back," Now how do you do it in Sahaja Yoga? As you have the photograph you may use it. Put a light before the photograph. Light is the way you cure your Agnya Chakra. Always. Light or the Sun‚ because Christ resides in the Sun. So what do you do‚ is to put a light in front. Take another light behind and give an Aarti to your Agnya Chakra at the back. It is resided by Maha Ganapati and Maha Bhairava. So you just give an Aarti and Agnya Chakra will open. But how do you open this? Very simple thing is that‚ any thought comes to you‚ you should say ""I forgive"". This is the greatest weapon Christ has given us. You just say ""I forgive‚ I forgive"" and you can overcome your ego. This is the mantra for this Chakra in the front where you just say ""I forgive‚ I forgive‚ I forgive"" and you will find your Agnya Chakra will open out and you will find your ego will go away. Forgiveness is one of the biggest weapons human beings have got. But they are so stupid if I tell them ""forgive""‚ now what is there not to ""forgive""? They say it is very difficult to forgive. I say what is so difficult? What are you doing? Are you doing something when you are saying‚ ""I am forgiving"". Do you do something? Nothing! On the contrary when you do not forgive‚ then what is happening is‚ the person whom you do not forgive‚ is actually torturing you‚ while you are not torturing that person. So this is the mantra of the Agnya Chakra in front and at the back‚ as I told you‚ you have to move the light. Now somebody will‚ you see‚ one day they will do‚ two days they will do; that is not how the Sahaja Yoga is to be worked out. You have to really go all out to do it‚ and I have seen people who had eyes which were all bent like this‚ they could never raise their eyes‚ are now have open eyes‚ proper eyes with this working. It is very simple to be done.
There is one more thing that happens to our eyes‚ when the Swadhishthana Chakra goes out of order. It is represented here at the back‚ which is around this Back Agnya. So when you have diabetes or anything like that people start becoming blind. Because this Swadhishthana Chakra which is around goes on pressing it and that is how‚ that part which is surrounding this centre‚ oppresses and augments that centre‚ so that the eyes cannot see: there is no light. There is darkness and people have eyes open. You have seen many diabetic people get this blindness. So first of all cure your diabetes through curing your Swadhishthana. And also you can use an ice around your Swadhishthana at the back. But first of all if you improve your Swadhishthana you will feel much better. So the treatment of the front side is with light‚ and the treatment of the back is with water. But the best is also to use light or the water whichever way you like. Because if it is Swadhishthana you have to use the water but if it is just the possession‚ then you have to use-without diabetes‚ if it is a possession- then you have to just use the light. That is how we cure our Agnya Chakra.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/563,,,,Treatments,Candle treatment,,,Back Agnya,Swadhishthana,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now first before meditating in your heart‚ or you should see in your heart and there try to put your Guru in the core of it. After establishing in the heart you must bow to that with full devotion and dedication. Now whatever you do with your mind after Realization is not imagination because now your mind‚ your imagination is itself enlightened. So project yourself in such a way that you humble down at the feet of your Guru and now ask for the necessary temperament needed for meditation or atmosphere needed for meditation. Meditation is when you are one with the Divine. Now if there are thoughts coming in first you have to say the first mantra of course and then watch inside. Also you must say mantra of Ganesha‚ will help some people. And then you should watch inside and see for your self‚ which is the biggest hurdle.
First the thought‚ now for the thought you have to say the mantra of Nirvichara that ""Twameva sakshat‚ Nirvichara sakshat‚ Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi namoh namaha."" You should say thrice.
Sahaja Yogis: ""Om Twameva sakshat‚ Shri Nirvichara sakshat‚ Shri Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namaha"" - (3 times)
Mother: Now we come to the hurdle of your ego because see your thought has stopped now no doubt‚ but there""s still a pressure on the head. So if it is ego you have to say‚ ""Twameva sakshat‚ Mahat Ahankara""; Mahat means the great‚ Ahankara means the ego. ""Sakshat‚ Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi namoh namaha."" Say it thrice.
Sahaja Yogis: ""Om Twameva sakshat‚ Shri Mahat Ahankara sakshat‚ Shri Adi Shakti sakshat‚ Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namaha. Om Twameva sakshat‚ Shri Mahat Ahankara sakshat‚ Shri Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namaha.""
Mother: Again
Sahaja Yogis: ""Om Twameva sakshat‚ Shri Mahat Ahankara sakshat‚
Shri Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namaha.""
Now even now if you find that ego is still there then you have to raise your Left side to push it back to the right hand side with your hand‚ one hand towards the photograph. Push the Left side higher and Right side lower so the ego and superego get the balance. Do it seven times. Try to feel how you are feeling inside‚ you see. Now you raise your Kundalini up on the head and tie it up. Again raise your Kundalini up on the head and tie it up. Again raise your Kundalini and tie it up. Now at the Sahasrara you should say the mantra of Sahasrara thrice.
Sahaja Yogis: ""Om Twameva sakshat‚ Shri Kalki sakshat‚ Shri Sahasrara Swamini moksha pradayini Mataji‚ Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namaha. Om Twameva sakshat‚ Shri Kalki sakshat‚ Shri Sahasrara Swamini moksha pradayini Mataji‚ Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namaha. Om Twameva sakshat‚ Shri Kalki sakshat‚ Shri Sahasrara Swamini moksha pradayini Mataji‚ Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namaha.""
Mother: Now it""s opened out‚ you see. Now‚ you can open again your Sahasrara like this. Just take it down again and see that you are stationed there. Once this has been done then you go into meditation. This is like cleansing‚ you see‚ called as nyasa. Now if you find any other obstruction you can also say like if you have got say Mahakali""s problem‚ you can say that mantra‚ clear it and then you sit down for meditation.
Any individual you can take it out‚ like if you have the ego problem; if you think then you should start with Mahat Ahankara. It is what you have to find out. What is your problem? Where is the Kundalini stopping? You can feel it within yourself. Some of you may not feel. If you do not feel it‚ feel it on your fingers. If you are not feeling within yourself then feel it on your fingers‚ you can feel it. Reduce your breathing‚ will be better. Reduce your breathing as if stopping it.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/2992,,Meditation,Nirvichara Samadhi,,,,Left side ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sometimes these combinations work very well. When a dominating man tries to dominate a left handed person they are great friends‚ nothing like it. Because one dominates and another takes the domination. As soon as the left hand side person becomes little on the center or tries to come to the right‚ the dominating ones starts clashing. Then they are the worst enemies of each other. It happens like that‚ so be on the alert. Now a person who is on the negative‚ on the Left side should try to come in the center and in the same way a person who is on the Right side should come to the center.
Now how do you do it? Which is the way we can do it? Let us see. A person who is very much on the right hand side should try to become friendly with the left hand side and left hand side person should try to be friendly with the right hand side‚ supposing. Let us start like that. So what is the give and take in this thing? The person who is on the right hand side will be better organizer‚ maybe‚ may not be. At least will be a better orator or maybe a better sort of a leader‚ maybe‚ may not be‚ you can""t say. He may be the one who will suggest things and who will bring out things‚ who will say ""I""ll do this; I""ll do"" sort of thing maybe. The left hand person will be frightened but will be humble‚ more loving‚ more affectionate. He""ll be much more at the command of others. This one will be commanding and the other will be receiving the command. This will be there. Now how do we solve the problem of this mixture? The one who is very much on the ego side should try to obey the person who is on the left hand side and on the left hand side should try to command more on the right hand side person and should be accepted. (They)‚ it should be mutually understood. There should be a contract. Alright‚ ""I am an ego oriented person and you are superego oriented‚ now let us do one thing. You try to dominate me and I""ll try to obey you"". It will work out. It""s a psychological style. You just work it out.
Try somebody who is a Left sided person to dominate you. But rather difficult to get Left sided people here. They are very few. Because I believe some people were Left sided‚ but when it comes to ego they are worst than anybody else you see. So rather difficult‚ but you can have a person who is Left sided and let 10 ego oriented ask him to dominate you. Till he develops his ego‚ he""s alright. If he develops ego stop it. But with complete understanding‚ watching yourself how you develop‚ how far you go. A play should go on. Play with yourself. But if you are identified with yourself that ""I am always right‚ and nobody is right"" nothing can work out‚ I can tell you this much. Because if you are perfect I need not waste My words here. So the best way is to do this sort of a thing. Alright you order and I do. Come along let""s see what you say? Let you organize and we""ll do it. You tell us how to do it.

But at the same time there is another work going on‚ of the same incarnation‚ is the resurrection of the people. Such people can never be hurt. Nothing can happen to them. They""ll be always saved‚ everything will be saved for them because they are under the protection of their Mother.

So I hope you understand how important it is that your centers should be corrected‚ your road should be all right‚ that your Sushumna should be cleared because we are Madhya-margis (Followers of Central Path).

It""s very surprising that when these two powers meet‚ or when you reach Shiva principle through the Vishnu principle‚ then you realize that these two powers are so complementary and so much related to each other. There is no difference‚ in a way‚ between these two powers. And so keep your road‚ the madhyamarg (Central Channel)‚ clean and let the Kundalini pass through it.

Still the myth exists. You have to still go ""beyond"". So if you feel happy about some situation‚ you should know you are only happy before Realization‚ because it is giving support to your ego to bloat. And if you are unhappy‚ then you should know that there is some sort of suppression on your ego and there is super ego developing.
So both the situations have been of ""no help"" to you. Of ""no help"" to you for your growth except that both these institutions develops so much that you are away from the real experiencing. The real experiencing stops‚ because your attention is so much‚ muddled up. So on one side if you move- on the left hand side – your attention is muddled up with fear‚ with pain‚ with unhappiness‚ with hopelessness‚ dejection. The other side if you indulge too much- on to the right hand side – little bit also‚ you start getting elated‚ excited‚ over dominating. The colour of the Left side is blue‚ and the blue colour starts changing to the black.

15820,Subtle system cleansing‚ enlightenment and the techniques for ascent,,You are not to spoil your Ashrams‚ your centres - using them for a marriage searching society.," we have to talk about the maryadas (boundaries of pure relationships) that have to be observed by Sahaja Yogis.
One of the things I discovered here‚ in the West‚ that though we have understood the importance of Mooladhara‚ which is a very important thing‚ that unless and until we establish our Mooladhara fully we are not going to have speediest ascent. Despite all that‚ there are lingering things you see around.
Like‚ people start choosing their life-partners in Sahaja Yoga. That is not allowed. That is not allowed.
You are not to spoil your Ashrams‚ your centres - using them for a marriage searching society. You must respect this point‚ you must respect. If you have to marry‚ then you can find your life partners ""outside"" Sahaja Yoga - to begin with - But if you want to marry ""in"" Sahaja Yoga‚ then you should not go on searching people in Sahaja Yoga. It is ""very dangerous"" thing for Sahaja Yoga itself‚ and for you people. That is one thing one should ""never"" try to do with Sahaja Yoga. For all practical purposes you are brothers and sisters. And that""s why I always encouraged marriage between people who belong to another country or another centres.
As we are now having a big marriage programme‚ I would say that most of the marriages which were done like that‚ are ""very"" successful than the marriages that were selected and were done. It""s very wrong to do such a thing as to arrange your marriage with a Sahaja Yogi by yourself. It will be dangerous. I don""t want to say anything; but it wouldn""t turn out to be good because it is anti-God activity. Absolutely anti-God. You are supposed to develop your brahmacharya‚ you are supposed to develop your Mooladhara. Instead of that if you start using a Sahaja Yogini or a Sahaja Yogi for the selection of your married life‚ it""s going to be very very troublesome‚ your Mooladhara is not going to settle down. I mean that""s a bad stroke for your development.
Because of the background and the kind of the conditioning you have had‚ you people don""t understand that it is important to maintain the purity of the centres. And of every place. So any such relationship in one city is a very very wrong thing. It spoils everyone. To add up to the trouble‚ it""s a habit of people‚ I have heard‚ that they try to tease that """"you look better together""""‚ """"you""re nice together"""". They ""tease"" and enjoy. It""s a kind of a very perverted enjoyment of mooladhara. To tease others‚ """"You are looking very nice with him‚ and you better marry him."""" It""s a kind of a romantic non- sense.
Of course‚ for all this‚ yogis - they have to have a Brahmacharya. But even if you can""t have brahmacharya. You must have ""Maryadas."" Not to tease each other and enjoy that kind of a non-sense‚ when the marriage is not settled; - if marriage is settled it is alright. And this kills completely the joy of marriage‚ because there is no curiosity left. And many a times I find that ""absurd"" relations are established.
Some of them are really no good. And they will really be detrimental and some of them are never established. So if they are established‚ they are wrong‚ and if they are not established‚ they are heartbreaking.
So all this kind of thing you should not do. You have got experiences of people who married outside and brought ""wonderful"" people to Sahaja Yoga. If you can do it‚ you should do it. If you have to marry Sahaja Yogi‚ you should not marry them at the cost of destroying the purity and the idealism it has. For your own sake‚ for your ""own"" pleasures you should not spoil the name of Sahaja Yoga. That is one thing I have seen‚ so I would say that today‚ as it is the day of purity between relationships‚ let us know that you have to treat each other as brothers and sisters. No such play should be followed. Don""t allow your mind to drift into this. Because if you allow‚ then there""s no end to it. As it is‚ you know how hard it is to bring you back to normalcy.
When Christ had said‚ "" Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes""‚ He did not say it because it was not practical. It is quite practical for Sahaja Yogis. And there is nothing to worry about marriages so much‚ what is so important ? So many are married and what has happened to them. ""Even"" with the Sahaja Yoga marriage‚ some have failed because of these bad habits.
So you ""better"" get rid of these bad habits before marriage.
Because after marriage also they go on like this‚ and searching for boys and girls. Because if these habits are not curbed‚ ""before"" marriage‚ then they go on lingering on. So‚ one should not try to do all these things before marriage. And I have seen such marriages are never‚ never successful so far.
And even if they are‚ it is a sort of make-believe thing. It doesn""t give real joy‚ it""s a joyless pursuit. May be in one case - may be - successful‚ that does not mean that you take help from such difficult things‚ but have ""normal"" marriage which are enjoyable‚ which have created permanent bondages between people"".",https://www.amruta.org/p/1453,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

15890,Subtle system cleansing‚ enlightenment and the techniques for ascent,,  ...one does not feel the vibrations despite Realization,"""The Kundalini is like a rope with many threads. She rises by unfolding her coils piercing every Chakra. The width of the Kundalini or the number of threads start diminishing as She ascends if the higher charkas are not open or if the piercing points in the charkas are constricted. If the lower charkas are open the Kundalini rises as a whole‚ but if the higher charkas are not open then the constriction does allow few threads to pass. So it is very necessary to have at least the lower charkas cleansed. In the western mind the higher charkas are better but as their Mooladhara Chakra is in jeopardy‚ the force is very weak and their own sensitivity very poor.
When the Kundalini rises without any hurdles‚ it reaches the Agnya and spread on the lower brain plate like a cloud‚ so a heaviness or sleepy feeling crawls. I say that first the mother puts you to sleep. The second feeling is when the vital force of Kundalini melts down over the Ida and Pingala. As if the cloud of the vital force starts pouring bliss. Gradually the head feels as if the lead is being taken off. One feels relaxed. Now again these two channels carry it down up to Nabhi and now a new force from Kundalini joins it. Then the triple force rises which opens the Agnya. At this time eyes get closed. The pupils start dilating.
Now the head gets clearer but some feel a mild pressure or throbbing at Sahasrara. The Agnya crossing creates the thoughtless awareness. You feel the silence of Sahasrara. At Sahasrara the Kundalini accumulates. A kind of release starts as the Brahmarandhra (fontanel bone) opens. It works slowly with some‚ but with most of them it is with a gush. At that moment‚ the sadhaka (disciple) feels the cool breeze of the vibrations. This is ""Realization"". There are many who have got jagruti (awakening) and have got the curing power but they cannot remain in thoughtless awareness. They touch it for a minute or so. But the process of Kundalini oozing out works out with time and ultimately they reach a stage of doubtless awareness.
With some like X it was a quick permanent ascent; he felt as if two bath of ice fell on his hands and started melting. The cooling crawled into his Being. If the Vishuddhi is doubtful or stretched and constricted‚ then‚ one does not feel the vibrations despite Realization‚ meaning the piercing of the Brahmarandhra.

15960,Subtle system cleansing‚ enlightenment and the techniques for ascent,,This does not mean that if you have to use spectacles‚ you become an unholy or improper person,"""Now let""s consider the reason why the Agnya Chakra is spoiled. One of the main reasons of this deterioration is your eyes. You should take great care of the eyes‚ as they are very important. Then the Agnya Chakra is also spoiled on account of bowing before or touching one""s head at the feet of an unauthorized guru. That is why Jesus Christ has told not to bow one""s head before every person or place‚ because by doing so‚ you unknowingly lose everything whatever you have gained. You should bow your head only before an authorized person that is one who is an incarnation of God. Do not bow before any wrong place. This is very important. If you bow your head before a wrong person or a place‚ your Agnya Chakra will get constricted.
In Sahaja Yoga I have noticed that nowadays‚ many persons have spoiled their Agnya Chakras. The reason is that these people follow a wrong guru or bow before or touch their head at wrong places. Many of the eye diseases are caused due to such wrong practices. In order to keep the Agnya Chakra in proper order‚ one should always read the scriptures and the sacred texts. One should never read unholy literature. Many people may say‚ ""what does that matter? On account of our profession‚ we have to do certain things which may not be strictly proper"". But then by doing such unholy activities the eyes get spoiled. I never could understand as to why people are bent upon doing wrong deeds. Even by looking at any unchaste and filthy man the Agnya Chakra may get constricted.
Jesus firmly said‚ ""Thou shall not commit adultery. But I tell you‚ thou shall not have adulterous eyes"". Thus it again comes to the eyes. If your eyes are unholy‚ you have eye troubles and your eyes get weakened. This does not mean that if you have to use spectacles‚ you become an unholy or improper person. It is the law of nature that you have to use spectacles at an advanced age. The eyes are spoiled because you do not keep them steady and are always moving them from one place to another. So also the attention of some people is constantly shifting from one object to another. These people are not even aware that such action spoils the eyes.
The other reason of deterioration of the Agnya Chakra lies in the manner in which you work. If you over-work then you become work-conscious. The work that you are doing may be good‚ but even then‚ if it is beyond the normal level‚ be it over-reading‚ over-stitching or over-thinking‚ it will spoil the Agnya Chakra. The reason is that while you over-work‚ you forget God. During the course of such work‚ God-consciousness does not stabilize in you"".",https://www.amruta.org/p/5550,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So what is going to work out is the Mother earth and the water element which is cooling. Even ice is very helpful to the people who are Right sided.

When we say we are going to meditate‚ it has no meaning. We have to be in meditation. Either you are inside the house or outside the house. You cannot be inside the house and then say that‚ ""Now I""m outside the house"". Or when you are outside the house‚ you cannot say‚ ""I""m inside the house"". In the same way‚ we  ... you are moving in three dimensions of your life‚ of emotional and physical and mental being. You are not inside yourself. But when you are inside‚ that you are in thoughtless awareness‚ then not only that you are there‚ but you are everywhere - because that is the place  ... that is the point where you are really in universal. [?]. From there you are in contact with the principle‚ with the shakti‚ with the power that permeates into every particle that is matter‚ into every thought that is in motion [emotion?]‚ into every planning and thinking of the whole world. You permeate into all the elements that have created this beautiful earth. You permeate into earth; you permeate into ""Akasha"" [Hindi/Sanskrit word meaning sky/ether]‚ into ""Teja"" [meaning light]‚ into sound. But your movement is very slow. Then you say‚ ""I""m meditating"" – that means you are moving in permeation with the universal being. But you are not moving yourself. You are just unloading yourself‚ to be free from the weight of things that do not allow you to move.
When you are in meditation‚ you must allow yourself to be in thoughtless awareness. There‚ the unconscious itself‚ the ""Achetana"" itself will take charge. You will start moving with the force of ""Atita"" [Hindi/Sanskrit word meaning ""beyond""]. The unconscious is going to work it out. It is going to take you there‚ where it wants you to go. You keep to thoughtless awareness all the time. Try to keep to thoughtless awareness as much as you can. When you are in thoughtless awareness‚ you must know that you are in the kingdom of God and His people‚ His arrangements‚ His consciousness‚ is going to look after you. Even when you are giving vibrations to other people‚ I have noticed that you are not in thoughtless awareness. If you give vibrations in thoughtless awareness‚ you will not catch anything. Because‚ all these entities that enter into you‚ all these material problems that come into you‚ come when you are in those three dimensions. Through Sahaja Yoga‚ you have opened your gates of your own being; you have entered into your own kingdom. But you do not keep there: you come out of it and again you go back and settle down – doesn""t matter. You should not feel so disappointed about it‚ so frustrated. You know people have worked for thousands of years and they could not separate themselves from themselves. Only you people – the Sahaja Yogis‚ whom are made after the pattern of Shri Ganesh himself – are so powerful‚ that they can give awakening and realization to other people. Even if you are caught up‚ you have seen you have powers. Even if you feel that the vibrations are not coming‚ you know you have powers. You can give realizations to others. In your presence people get realization. But you have to be that power completely. Supposing there""s something wrong with your car but it  ... as long as it is moving‚ it""s all right. You have to repair it. You have to repair all the time all our moods‚ which we have caused ourselves by our foolishness‚ by our lust‚ by our greed‚ by so many false identifications we carried with ourselves. We must have a complete attention towards our weaknesses and not towards our achievements. If we know what are our weaknesses‚ it""s better - that we can really swim across better. Supposing‚ on a ship there is a hole and the water is coming in through that hole‚ the attention of all the crew‚ of all the staff and the captain itself will be on that hole from where the water is coming in and nowhere else. In the same way‚ you must be on the watch-out. There are so many pitfalls for a Sahaja Yogi‚ I have seen it. Of course‚ even the past is over  ... even the past can be overcome. In the present also they have many shadows of the past working. For example‚ when you are sitting in a group‚ you are involved with each other. Those who are involved with each other‚ by any relationship whatsoever‚ must know that this kind of involvement is not going to help them to attain their individual ascent. Everybody is ascending individually though you are collectively contacted with each other and in communication – but the ascendance is individual‚ absolutely individual. So whether he is your son‚ brother‚ sister‚ wife‚ friend‚ you must remember that you are not responsible for their ascendance. You cannot help them for their ascendance. Only Mother""s Grace and their own desire‚ their own effort to give up all that is three dimensional‚ will help them. So whenever a thought comes like that‚ you must know that you have not attained the thoughtless awareness in its full extent. And that""s Saabdi?]. Meditation is the most Sahaja method.
Then we have prayers and we have also Puja. Prayers are also  ... if said in your heart with the feeling of complete surrendering and asking for the eternal – it will be granted. Just ask for that and the rest will take [care of itself? [Feedback on recording]] step-by-step. All the Sahaja Yogis have a problem. And they have problems because of their past‚ because of their future aspirations. Now when you have problems‚ in Sahaja Yoga you have learnt how to overcome them. There are so many methods other than meditation – you know them very well; that you must know what is the Chakra‚ where the Kundalini is. Now if the Kundalini has been stopped by a certain Chakra‚ which is not working‚ you shouldn""t get frustrated about it. Supposing your instrument or your car has stopped on the way‚ what""s the use of getting frustrated with it? You have to learn the mechanism; you have to be a good technician and then you can manage it very well. So all the techniques of Sahaja Yog must be learned and mastered. This you can only do by giving it to others and learning from correcting them and correcting yourself. There is nothing to be frustrated – that""s the worst thing. If you get frustrated and unhappy with yourself‚ then there is going to be a problem. You have to laugh at yourself and laugh at your mechanism that is out of gear. When you start identifying yourself even with the instrument‚ then you are not there. You are not the Chakra‚ you are not the different Channels – you are the awareness. You are the power. You are the Kundalini. So you don""t have to worry about all these things being not in their proper conditions. If they are not‚ you can solve it. Just now the lights went off. If the lights have went off because of the electricity failure‚ it""s a serious thing. But if the lights have gone out because there is a fused bulb‚ oh‚ you can replace it; you can do all that. So there is no need to worry if your Chakras are spoilt. Worrying itself‚ or frustrating yourself‚ itself is a wrong attitude towards Sahaja Yog. Sahaja in other terminology also means  ... means is a simple [THING? not clear] Sahaja means  ... to be Sahaja means in  ... I can say how Tulsidas has said‚ ""Jaiserakhahutaise hi rahu"" (You keep me as You like). That kind of an attitude takes your attention inside – because outside it is let alone to the dogs. Let alone  ... we are not bothered about the outside part. As you people‚ I will be‚ in that manner  ... and you will be surprised everything clicks out very well. Even‚ sometimes‚ you might feel: ""I should reach a certain place‚ I must have this Bhajan done‚ I must get these things done"" and it""s not done sometimes. Sometimes by mistake something as you want is not done. You must accept it as the will of God. That is what He desires – it""s all right. That is the desire of God and now you are one with His desire. You are here to communicate the desire of God to the whole world. At a  ... at this stage if you start having your own desires and ideas about yourself‚ then when will you become the desire of God? This I-ness has to go away. That is what meditation is – where you are no more ""I"" but it is ""You"". Kabirdasji has written a beautiful poem about it. That when the goat is living and kicking‚ she says ""Mein‚ mein"" - that is ""I‚ I"". But then she dies and her intestines are drawn out into wires and some saint fixes them on the ""Tutari"" – that instrument that they have – ""Ektari"" as they call it‚ and he goes on pulling it with his fingers‚ then it says ""Tu hi‚ Tu hi‚ Tu hi"" – that is ""You are‚ You are‚ You are"". That is how we have to die and we have to be resurrected. You have been already‚ but Sahajyog as I have told you‚ is a ""Kheer"" or what you call this sweet dish cooked in a raw pot – Kachche ghade ki kheer hai [in Hindi]. So the soil of the raw pot also is mixed up. But your attention can be with the ""Kheer""‚ with the milk‚ and can drop out all that is the mud of the raw pot. That discrimination is spontaneous‚ it is there‚ you have got it – self- actualization. You can feel yourself. You know you are not that. You have started talking about your Chakras in the same manner. But the only thing‚ the only problem‚ or the only defect that is with the Sahajayogi is‚ that still‚ though he is there‚ his attention is involved with outside. That""s the only defect. If the attention is removed  ... How to remove? That""s the point‚ that is the first thing. Once you say ""how to remove"" means you have created the three-dimensional involvement. You are not to remove: it is there. If your attention is outside‚ then I would have said‚ ""No‚ your attention has to go inside. It has not got it[not clear]"". But it is there. You are sitting there. I am sitting here. But my attention is outside. I have to just feel myself where I am‚ that""s all. Some have felt it; some have achieved it. You know among yourselves there are some who have gone very high up.The other method we employ is of Puja. I""ve found that works very well with human beings: Puja - because it satisfies lots of demands of the past habits‚ that you feel that you are doing something about it. Then you start giving whatever you think God has given you‚ the blessings. And the ishi and Muni have found out – they""re very clever people – they have found out how to please the Deities‚ how to please the Mother. So they have old you‚ as they have told you even in this lifetime of mine‚ how to please Her. They say She is ""Stutipriya"" [Sanskrit word] – that means She likes praises. It""s not that. But when you praise someone from the heart that means you are accepting it. And that is the time the Chakras start creating a force by which you are thrown‚ you are triggered‚ into that realm of God. So these Puja methods and prayer methods and the Mantra methods have been devised and found out by great thinkers of Sahajayoga‚ the great masters of Sahajayoga‚ and it is the effort – or you can say the effortless effort – of the Sahajayogis that makes my body vibrate. Extracts the essence from my body‚ I should say. They make  ... It makes the infinite release itself through this finite being and it works‚ it clicks - I have seen it - it works out very well. But you know that after Puja I get little tired because if you cannot receive it‚ that force‚ I want to sleep and get rid of that additional vibrations into ""Sushupti"" [Sanskrit] by entering into the infinite state. If you could receive whatever I am emitting‚ in balance‚ with your Puja‚ then only it helps better. That means‚ when you are doing Puja‚ also receive it. Be in thoughtless awareness when you are doing Puja‚ completely concentrated in receiving. But while Puja people are talking‚ I""ve seen‚ they""re t  ... moving about. I mean‚ I don""t know how to explain it. That""s the time something is oozing out – the nectar – and you just receive it at that time with full devotion. It is oozing out. If you feel my vib  ... vibrations of my Chakras at that time‚ you will realize that even the minute‚ small little‚ wheels in my body are moving at different space  ... at different speed‚ at different dimension. And I really don""t know how to explain – but you see it creates a melody. You have to receive it and it is a melody individually – suitable for every individual – and when you receive it‚ it triggers in you that state of infinity. So at the time of Puja you must know that you  ... all your attention should be in reception.
Today is a very great day with the New Year. Within two years from today Satyayuga is going to start. It""s a great day for many things that nine days are celebrated after this for the advent of Mother. It is the date‚ or I should say: the calendar was started by my forefathers and they perceived that this is the day when the Mother started creating. And this is the day She created Ganesha to begin with. In the ""Utpatti"" stage‚ She started her work this day and that""s why they put this date as the first date because the time started from this date long time back. And that""s why this date is very important‚ and if you cross this date then you are beyond time. You have to step on to this date and go beyond. You have to step on your Dharma‚ on to your religion‚ and go beyond – ""Dharmateet"". You have to be those three Gunas and to go beyond – ""Gunateet"". You are all those three. But the steps on which you are standing have to be all right‚ or those which are crossed or  ... have to be all right too. So when you are beyond‚ you have to repair those steps‚ which you have crossed somehow‚ which can be done through meditation‚ Puja‚ prayers. But the most important‚ the greatest advancement is done by giving  ... the universal through your universal being. You all must dedicate your life to Sahaja yoga and give more and more. Among us there are some people who have given a lot and by that they have achieved a lot too. You have to give‚ talk about it‚ spread it and bring more people to get this‚ otherwise they will be left out of evolutionary process. There""s no time for you to doubt and think; don""t waste your time in all these useless activities. If you have still doubts‚ its better to give up. It""s high time that you get into the process.
So today I wish you happy New Year for a journey in the spiritual life of this world. You have to think of all the Sahajayogis who are far away from us and our thoughts should carry our love for them and they should be blessed as you all are blessed here.

And the whole thing came on the Earth -as if a torrential rain or a waterfall- with such tremendous force‚ as if I was unaware and got stupefied. The happening was so tremendous and so unexpected that I was stunned and totally silent at the grandeur.
I saw the Primordial Kundalini rising like a big furnace‚ and the furnace was very silent but a burning appearance it had‚ as if you heat up metal‚ and it had many colors. In the same way‚ the Kundalini showed up as a furnace‚ like a tunnel; as you see these plants you have here for coal burning that create electricity. And it stretched like a telescope and came out one after another‚ Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Just like that.
And the Deities came and sat on their seats‚ golden seats‚ and then they lifted the whole of the head like a big dome and opened it‚ and then this Torrential Rain complete drenched Me. I started seeing all that and got lost in the Joy. It was like an artist seeing his own creation‚ and I felt the Joy of great fulfillment.

16130,,,,"""At the end of 1946‚ I reached the conclusion that I had to do it in a very deep silent way‚ and through the inner movement of My being I had to find out what was so problematic about human centres and their three channels.
Ultimately in the year 1970 I had to go to a seminar of one of the so- called masters because he requested My husband who had his friend staying in that place‚ who arranged My visit. I was amazed to see this man‚ who was ten years younger than Me‚ looking at least twenty years older than Me. But he mesmerized all the people and they shouted and screamed and some barked like dogs. Just by mesmerizing‚ he was taking them to their past.
This really shocked Me. I was sitting under a tree to watch what he was doing? At night I went alone to the seashore‚ sat there alone meditating about how‚ somehow or the other‚ I could use My own Kundalini for the en- masse Realization of the people. That was the moment when it worked‚ and it clicked. I was surprised‚ that with a little deeper penetration‚ I could work it out. The experience was like this. I saw My Kundalini rising very fast like a telescope opening out and it was a beautiful colour that you see when the iron is heated up‚ a red‚ rose colour‚ but extremely cooling and soothing. The Kundalini went through My fontanel bone area (Brahma Randhra) which was open from My childhood and was pouring out Divine vibrations (Purna Brahma). But this new experience gave Me a new dimension of understanding of My Divine force. It came like a very promising reality that it was the time for Me to start My collective work. I found that the whole of My being was filled with great peace and joy. I opened My eyes‚ went to this false master and told him‚ ""Now the last centre can be opened for everyone"". I was amazed to see that he had no idea about the centre‚ or about the three channels which I knew from My very childhood. I found out that there were so many of them who were very false masters and were just money- oriented ‚ working through mesmerism by encouraging anti Christ activities of immorality or by saying that this world is coming to an end"".",https://www.amruta.org/p/43729,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16140,Seeking Divine Knowledge,,Q: Is truth beyond sense perception?,"Answer: It is absolutely because if what we perceive through our senses‚ whatever we perceive through our senses‚ is the truth‚ then we don""t have to seek anymore. Whatever we perceive through our senses is what is very apparent‚ gross; not the subtle. What is ""behind"" the gross‚ we cannot perceive. For example‚ we cannot say how to make an atom. We cannot say how an amoeba is made into a human being. We cannot make one monkey into a human being‚ can we‚ through our perception of the senses? Through our perception of the senses we cannot do the subtle thing that is behind the gross. So we cannot perceive through the senses. But once you have perceived it you can feel it‚ through your senses. This is the second point.",https://www.amruta.org/p/4675,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16150,Seeking Divine Knowledge,,Q: Shri Mother‚ we feel the same Chakras more on the legs than on the fingers.,Answer: The integration is not there‚ that's why. You have to attend collectively. You have to be more collective; the body has to be collective. The thing is that if you are not a collective person then sometimes you'll not feel them on the legs‚ sometimes on the hand‚ sometimes in the head. That's not a good thing. You should try to be more collective‚ you should meet more people‚ take more interest. You see‚ the body of yours won't work out efficiently unless and until you use it. Because individually‚ you see‚ if you work out‚ it will not develop collectively‚ because where are you using it? You are correcting your self to give it to others. And if you don't give it‚ if you do not work it out in a collective way‚ there is no circulation. For example‚ there's a‚ say‚ a fruit is there and you take it out of a tree‚ and you mature it outside. But it will decay very soon. But if it is connected with the tree‚ it will mature by itself giving a proper identity to itself and to the tree. And taste would be better. And those who will come under that tree will receive the fruits of that tree. But a fruit which is separated will be lost after some time. That is how one has to very collective.,https://www.amruta.org/p/2706,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I also sometimes feel like crying‚ but seldom. So sometimes men must cry also.

Now spiritually‚ to develop discrimination is by vibratory awareness. When your vibrations are developed‚ then you automatically discriminate. You are such a big computer.

16200,The Basics Of Spreading,,Purity,"In spiritual ascent when we say it""s easy‚ it""s not so easy as you think‚ because it has worked out since ages in a very deep way and even your Mother has worked very hard to achieve it. So somebody has done the job. So‚ if it is easy you should thank your stars that it""s not difficult for you‚ instead of doubting why is it so easy that you want to contribute something to it. All right you can‚ but first take advantage of what is available then you can contribute something more to it  ... First know that whatever is achieved is Self-realisation and the cleansing power of Shri Ganesha. Establish Shri Ganesha within you. First of all you must establish Him and then you can use it for others‚ for yourself and for bettering and bettering the methods of Sahaja Yoga that you have learnt  ...
I have to say about the ego part why; people have so much ego in the west; One of things is this; the Right side is like an accelerator‚ the Left side is like the break. So if the break is not all right‚ naturally the accelerator cannot be controlled. So logically our Mooladhara should be brought round and must be put right. We should work very hard to do that. If your break is established then whatever work you do of Sahaja Yoga‚ you will not get into Ego problems and ego cannot anymore control you. So that is very important‚ specially in the west‚ where it is very much destroyed‚ the idea of auspiciousness and of holiness. So that is the power of any angel and that has to be fully established in us. Then on that power we""ll work out‚ which gives you discretion which gives you egolessness.
What we need are the people who are completely drenched into the purity of love. So‚ from love we go to another point which is purity. And the purity is a subject which has been talked about by many people. That you should be pure‚ you should be absolutely open and people should know everything about you. I don""t think that is purity. Purity is that which purifies others! If you are a pure person‚ then others will be purified. They have to be purified. Now supposing you have certain ideas about yourself‚ you think that you are very highly placed as a Sahaja Yogi and that you are full of love. Maybe it""s all imaginary. Does it purify others ? Does your purity purify others ? Can it give them awakening ? Can they be Realised Souls ? And then‚ how much do you value the purity‚ the power of purity ? And how many people you give Realisation (to)? Or you have kept it to yourself ? How many places you have been to spread this purity ? Purity has to be spread. And without any doubt‚ in your own purity‚ you should do it because it""s a very very powerful thing.
Purity is very powerful. It may not act on one or two persons‚ doesn""t matter. There could be some very very nasty‚ horrible fellows‚ doesn""t matter. But it will have an effect on very many sensitive persons who want to become Sahaja Yogis. You have to just test it. How people like you and how they are impressed by you. The Paramchaitanya‚ this all pervading power of Divine Love‚ flows through you because you are pure. If you are impure‚ then it will stop at different chakras‚ it won""t work. So purity of temperament‚ purity of love - what does that mean ? That you love somebody because that person has got spirituality. You love that person because there is purity‚ and you go to places just to spread the purity among them. A pure person will never create a problem. It""s the impure person who every day can start with this problem or that problem and that  ...",https://www.amruta.org/p/1790,,,,,,,,,,,Ganesha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Advice,,,
16210,The Basics Of Spreading,,The Source,"Now as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned‚ the basic thing is Kundalini‚ and the Kundalini‚ as I told you‚ is the pure desire. Again listen to it carefully‚ ""Pure desire"" That means all other desires are impure. There is only one pure desire and that is to be one with the divine‚ one with the Brahma‚ one with God. That""s the only pure desire. All other desires are impure. So train you mind gradually to achieve that desire as the main thing. If you train your mind in that fashion then you can develop pure desire. So all other desires will negate‚ gradually. Alright. Now this desire‚ to be one with the divine‚ is the purest and the highest and to achieve that‚ what have we to do?
To achieve that‚ you have to keep your Mother pleased‚ very simple  ....""So how to please mother ? that you should try to see for yourself. What kind of a thing pleases me the best  .... I have nothing but Compassion  .... Desire that you will keep your Mother pleased.
My achievement is the complete manifestation of your Divine powers. It""s very simple‚ made so simple. I am only pleased by people who are simple‚ innocent‚ who are not tricky‚ who are loving‚ affectionate to each other.

16220,The Basics Of Spreading,,State of the World,"When I started my life‚ I saw the complicated Sahasrara. And the more I tried to solve the complications within my own awareness‚ the more it became more difficult. Because if you see my age‚ in fifty years you can see‚ how much complicated human beings have become. And after opening the Sahasrara‚ when I came to the west‚ within these 16 years‚ I found that they are now incorrigible.
Now the stage for you is laid down to ascend higher  ... You can see how‚ when you have a program‚ there will be 500 people for the program and within two weeks‚ all will disappear. Because when the ascent takes place‚ the Kundalini pushes out the ego and brings the person close to reality. But again that ego‚ which is being built up so fast in its speed‚ overpowers the speed of the Kundalini and covers the head. Then it suggests that how can you have godly life ? You will miss all the alcohol‚ all the madness‚ all the fun of life. That they feel‚ they loose all the freedom to become mad  ...
The other side of it is that the ""Asuri Vidya"" the black vidya has taken over. As Shri Krishna‚ had warned that-in the 15th chapter-that if Asuri Vidya takes over‚ then the ""Suddha Vidya"" cannot compete with the speed of Asuri Vidya  .... Even at the stage‚ where we are Sahaja Yogis‚ we are shy of our godly life  ... I mean‚ even when Sahaja Yogis are convinced about the Godliness of Sahaja Yoga‚ still they are shy. Now your know your Mother does not take any money from you‚ on the contrary she spends‚ you all have gained out of it. But when it comes to giving‚ everybody feels shy. From that background you are coming to the light of God""s Grace. But you don""t want to dash at it‚ you want to take your time‚ gradually‚ so gradually‚ that may be‚ you may loose your chance. So in the awareness of Sahaja Yogis‚ where you know all about your chakras‚ you know about vibrations‚ you know how you relate to others‚ still all this knowledge is for personal advantages. The shadow of the past still lingers on‚ even when you have this new awareness.

It""s so effective‚ but unless and until you become aware of your own powers‚ how will you work it out. It would be like a dead machine that has everything but nobody is there to work it out.
All the time I had to go through very‚ very hazardous times and sometimes I felt that I may have to take another birth‚ the way things are so difficult for Me. But now‚ for you‚ it has been very easy‚ as if the one who makes the road has to work very hard‚ but those who walk on that‚ they don""t realise how easily they have got it. And if they realise this‚ then they will realise also ""Let many walk on this road‚ which was created with such patience‚ understanding and love.
I have to really see you all Sahaja Yogis doing your level best to change this world - has to be changed. As it is‚ humanity has to be saved through you and nobody else. No president‚ no prime minister‚ no minister‚ none of these people can change the world And seeing it‚ it is you who are entitled. You have got this power. Do you realise your own status‚ your own being‚ which has risen so high ? It is not there. If that realisation is there‚ you would go all out to express your love and compassion to other people‚ to make them realise‚ what they are ?
Only with Sahaja Yoga you can save this world. There""s no other way out. Whatever you may try‚ say‚ to help the poor‚ to help this and that‚ is something very‚ very superficial. Best thing is to give Realisation to every person you see. We have seen children. They""re coming up. They""ll be great Sahaja Yogis also. I can see that. But before them‚ you have to show your own merits of what you have done. It""s not a static work. It""s a big movement‚ which has to be really explosive and unless and until such a great step is taken‚ I don""t know who will be blamed for the doomsday.
You are the one[s] who have to build up the destiny of human beings. Don""t pass it on as yourself as something nothing. You could never have got your Realisation. You""d never have come to Me. Among so many‚ you are the ones who came to Me and who asked for Realisation and got it. You know it cannot be forced. This Realisation cannot be forced. This awareness cannot be forced. And the growth of this awareness also cannot be forced.
You have to develop that attention deep down within yourself. And see for yourself what you have done. If you are still busy with the money problem or the power problem and this problem and that‚ you are a problem. You are not a Sahaja Yogi.
Sahaja Yogi is above everything else and is very powerful. Power will be achieved by them - power of love and compassion‚ which is not only words of love. It is not only act of loving others‚ but it is a powerful personality that you will have‚ which will just emit that great Divine Light and can capture people; all should just take a very brave personality.",https://www.amruta.org/p/1498,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Any extreme attitude towards life must be brought down. Now‚ here we find that the will acts to oppose and in an opposite direction. For example‚ people become obstinate. They do not want to accept that we have to balance and they say‚ ""Oh ! I am all right‚"" and they""ll give all explanations to show‚ they are all right. For whom are you giving the explanations ? You are fighting with yourself. Why ? Because you are not yet integrated fully within yourself.
So‚ the second point is the integration‚ integration of your attention. Integration comes in when you do some thing‚ you wish the same thing‚ you enjoy the same thing.

16460,Dynamism In Spreading,,Speed,"I was happy that a suggestion has come from America about making a video film and things like that. And then there are obstructions‚ how are we going to get money‚ what is going to happen.  You just start it‚ you'll get it‚ you have powers. Everything will be synchronized properly‚ you just start doing it‚ but if you behave like human beings – first think then plan it out‚ and then cancel it – it's not going to work out.

Though Hanumana is running on the Pingala Nadi all the time‚ what He does is to spoil our plans. Because instead of Him‚ we run on the Pingala. ""This is all right‚ you running it? I'll put you right!"" So He sidetracks all our plans all the time‚ and that's how all our planning fails. We are particular about timing‚ about things of no importance‚ but we are not particular about timings of our progress in Sahaja Yoga.

We must have targets‚ we must have fixed times – all right by this time we have to achieve‚ but do it little faster is better. All other things can be managed‚ but this is your job‚ nobody's going to do it.

Nobody's going to do it‚ it's your job. I mean you are not going to run the train‚ you are not going to run aeroplanes and you don't have to run any administration and this stupid politics‚ but you have to do Sahaja Yoga. You have to spread it‚ you have to bring it to a level that people can see it.

Now eighteen years have passed‚ this is the nineteenth year. So today is the first day of Hanumana's Puja. I must say you have to venture. You have to venture without any fear‚ collectively and individually‚ forgetting as to what will happen‚ I mean you won't go to jails‚ you will not be crucified‚ be sure on that. I mean if you lose your job‚ you can get another‚ and if you don't get a job‚ you can get a dole all right. So you don't have to worry about all useless things which human beings sit down and worry [about]; but despite that they achieve work‚ they do their jobs‚ and how much they're wedded to it I'm surprised. I've seen it in my family‚ how much they're wedded‚ they have to do this work‚ they have to get up in the morning‚ do this‚ do that.

But you are not aware that you are angels and this is your work. You have to do this and nothing else is important. I hope by today's puja‚ that enthusiasm‚ that venturesome nature will vibrate your Pingala‚ and without feeling any ego about it‚ in the most humble manner as Hanumana was‚ you will do the jobs.

Hanumana‚ imagine‚ He was given a beautiful necklace of gold – with big‚ big balls for Him to wear – by Sita. And He opened all of them one by one‚ He said‚ ""There is no Rama in this‚ what will I do with this gold?""

So She said‚ ""Where is Rama?""

He opened His heart and showed it‚ ""See‚ Rama is here.""

If Rama is there‚ you cannot have ego. So‚ so much of dynamism and so much of humility – what a combination it was. And that's what you have to just manifest. The more you'll work‚ the more you'll assert yourself‚ you will find that humility is the only thing that helps. Obedience is the only thing that helps to carry out your work and you'll become humbler and humbler.  But if you think‚ ""Oh I am doing this"" – then finished. But if you know that it's done by the Divine – ""Paramchaitanya is doing everything‚ I am just an instrument"" – the humility will be there and you will be an effective instrument.

In this country today‚ it was very necessary and it was so timely. It was all organized by angels that we should have this puja here. But it's good for all of you. You have to really go and see the media people‚ go and see these ministers‚ go and see‚ say‚ Prince of Wales‚ go and see another person‚ meet them‚ make committees‚ see what you can do. Put your mind to it‚ ""What are we to do?""

But here only‚ ""My mother is sick‚ my child is sick‚ my this thing is sick‚ my friend is sick my       – still going on with it. If you start doing God's work‚ your worries are taken over‚ you don't have to worry about anything – just taken over. But it's not self propagation‚ it's not!  It's the propagation of the collective.

I hope today you have understood the subtle side of your being which is there‚ which is exhibiting‚ which I can see clearly and that you will‚ all of you will‚ in your meditation become aware of what you have within yourself. That's the greatest thing that will please the Divine‚ and Divine will look after you fully.  With the same confidence as the angels like Hanumana you have to go further and work it out.",https://www.amruta.org/p/1586,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hanumana,,,,,,,,,,,Shri Rama,Sita,,,,,,,,,,,

If you are too right-sided‚ then what happens‚ it's like a pendulum‚ you move from right to left. Then psychosomatic troubles start. The best is first to remove the left‚ then is look after the Right side. Sahaja Yoga is a very simple way of clearing. It works.

16980,,,Shri Mataji Treatments Sahasrara Hamsa Nabhi Children Hair Eyes Massage (New York 1983) Sahaja,"You must put some heated butter in the nose‚ all of you.
Sahaja Yogi: In the… inside?
Shri Mataji: Inside. With a‚ with a dropper‚ all right? Heat‚ heat butter and sieve it out. And then‚ when it is slightly warm‚ not very warm‚ absolutely slightly warm‚ then put it in Vishuddhi. It's very important. Because the‚ I don't know in this country people‚ is a very simple thing to be done. Once in a while‚ about say‚ two-three days later or even every day‚ doesn't matter. It's like putting cream on your hands‚ you see‚ because the cold weather‚ also chops inside the lining of the nose and when you put this it makes a… nose smooth‚ and you don't get troubles of it.

It's very simple. All of you should do‚ all the Sahaja Yogis are supposed to do. There are so many things Sahaja Yogis are supposed to do – one of them is this – that try to keep your Hamsa chakra all right. By keeping your nose all right‚ you keep your Hamsa chakra better. So‚ better use this simple method of heating some ghee‚ we call it. You see‚ you can prepare it heated butter‚ keep it in a bottle with a dropper and heat it in the hot water. And then put it in the nose. Just like that‚ in the night‚ before sleeping. Even in the ears‚ you must put olive oil – is very important. For the teeth also‚ you must take some salt‚ put some olive oil‚ and rub your gums.

With that‚ you won't have to go to the dentist anymore. That's the best. I've never been to a dentist all My life and I don't want you to go to dentist anymore. So that's a very good way of rubbing your gums with vibrated salt and what you call‚ the olive oil. Also‚ you must oil your heads‚ every Saturday‚ with so much of oil‚ nicely. Oil it‚ massage you head and sleep off and next day wash off your head. You feel very much better. If any of you cannot get olive oil‚ the best is almond oil for the head. Keeps you very peaceful. Especially your children‚ you must massage them till they are five years of age‚ every night‚ when they go off to sleep‚ in the night.

Nicely‚ very‚ for before sleep. And then put some powder clean it out and let them sleep. Then the children won't be running and upset and all that. They'll become very quiet children‚ well behave children. Because you people don't massage the children all their lives‚ they are jumping. And all their lives‚ they're likely violent. You see‚ this is the nerves must be soothed down. A very simple method and as you are Realised people‚ you sooth them much more. All these small‚ small things must be taken care of‚ you see. Now if you have too much of cold‚ if you have too much of cold‚ then you can mix up little camphor‚ with oil and put that in the nose – little I said‚ not much.

That also is very good. That also soothes your cold and puts you right. This country has one big problem: is Vishuddhi chakra everywhere in the West – because of the cold. And in Sahaja Yoga it is compulsory that you must wear an undershirt. It is compulsory. Whatever may be – it is hot‚ cold‚ anything. In India even when extremely hot‚ you must wear an undershirt because when it is very hot you start perspiring and that perspiration causes problems. So‚ always wear an undershirt whether you are in a hot season or a cold season. That's a compulsion for Sahaja Yogis‚ that they must wear. And for all of them also is compulsory that they should always wear a muffler when they go out during winter time – it is an important thing.

And also put some these cotton wools in the ears‚ as I put it. For your sake I have to put it‚ because you are careless. So‚ I look after you by putting into My ears like this. So‚ you all should put it before going out. And keep your head covered in the night – when you sleep cover your head with something and then sleep. Because most of the time your body is all covered but the head is not covered. Because now you are realized souls‚ and your Sahasrara is weak. So‚ you must look after your Sahasrara. Cover you head‚ so that you won't have any problem. Also‚ you must verify what sort of a person you are.

If you have a liver problem‚ then you get a diet for that‚ which is here – people will tell you. If you Left sided person‚ if you have Left sided problem then you must know about the diet – what you have to take. For example‚ a person who's a Left sided should not take carbohydrates at all. On the contrary‚ should eat proteins in whatever form it is possible. In Sahaja Yoga‚ you know‚ we don't believe in vegetarianism or anything but we do believe that the muscles of the bigger animals than us are not good for our teeth‚ or for our body also because the structure of a muscular cell of a bigger animal is much bigger than ours.
And that's how they eat up. I mean even by mistake if I eat something or anybody asked Me the other day – behind My teeth were swollen up. So that's what it happens. It is an automatic reaction. And we are not supposed to use plastics in our clothes.

Also try to avoid – some percentage of plastic we may use‚ but not all the time plastics and nylons. And also‚ the food should not be eaten in plastics. You can eat it in paper – paper is all right‚ because it is – what you call – is good‚ doesn't matter. But you shouldn't eat in plastic‚ food‚ plastic with forks and spoons of plastic and… It's too much plastic in this country. So‚ be careful because plastic is anti-God‚ it is anti-human life‚ it is anti-biological processes. So‚ avoid plastics as far as possible. Be careful on that and also don't use made something out of absolute plastic. Like I've seen‚ I wanted to buy one pair of slippers for Myself – I couldn't get one in the whole of Europe. Because I didn't want a plastic.

And if you wear that‚ then you develop all kinds of skin troubles‚ skin diseases – so be careful on that. There are so many other things we are to be careful about‚ and because we have found out that these things that are harmful that's why we have made it compulsory: that every one of you must be careful. Because now you are become the temple of God. And the temple of God should be healthy. We don't want tubercular patients to go around as saints. Nobody is going to believe them. Sahaja Yogi: You just tell them about sugar. Shri Mataji: Now there's another falsehood about – thank God is now broken – that the sugar is against our… growth and all that. Sugar is very important for attention. Especially people who suffer from liver.

For example‚ people who are thin‚ mostly suffer from liver trouble. For them sugar is so important that if they don't take sugar‚ they'll become like the sugar cane which has come out of the machine‚ pressing machine‚ you see? Better take some sugar. Sugar is very important for your liver. Best carbohydrate is white sugar‚ not the red sugar. Red sugar is not good because it has got molasses – it's very heating. Some people have funny ideas here also about food. Like some of them believe that if you eat natural food – once I got something from natural store and I got diarrhea for five days. Because it was meant for animals not for the… human beings. Like some people eat‚ what you call them‚ [In Hindi or Marathi]. Cotton seed!

Now‚ cotton seed we give only to animals‚ you can't believe even. But I've seen in Switzerland‚ they give cotton seed in the bread. There was cotton seed in the bread. One or two is all right‚ but imagine‚ [In Hindi or Marathi]. We can give it to buffaloes only. And that was given and you get diarrhea with it. You see‚ this's a very strong thing. In the same way‚ very soft food is also not good. We have to be in the centre in everything.

Don't eat very rough food‚ you see like… some of the bread in France‚ you know‚ even in England we find‚ it breaks your gums completely. So that kind of a crispy stuff not need it. It should be such that your gums are looked after – they are delicate things and have food which is good for you. Don't go with nationality‚ don't go with the fashion but whatever is good for you that should be done. And you find out about yourself‚ what is your temperament‚ what sort of a food will soothe you and accordingly you should eat. Of course‚ everybody is free to do what they like but we can only advise them that this will soothe you‚ and you'll find it will be very helpful to all of you. It will help you. For your hair growth‚ also you should get vibrated oil and use it. Now‚ you'll be surprised the other day somebody saw Warren and he said‚ ""This is the same fellow? Looks much younger.

So‚ I said‚ ""Yes‚ he had a baldness from here to here‚ like that. And now he's grown hair. With proper care‚ you can have your hair quite intact for quite some time – if you look after your hair. But hair is why important‚ is not so much look‚ but the Sahasrara. And if you put oil in your Sahasrara every week‚ you will have a smooth personality‚ a smooth behaviour‚ a smooth movement‚ you'll deal with other people in a gentle manner. So this is very necessary. In India we actually have a big masseur attached to a family‚ see – is a very hefty fellow. And he comes to massage the men‚ you see‚ he just sits on their body and really finishes them off completely. At the first shot they are dead. Then he uses their body fully and push it and sits on them and rubs them.

With the‚ one clap – you see‚ five‚ six of them will be jumping on five‚ six people – with clap‚ they'll go round. By the time the second job comes in the person is finished. That's how they manage. But that‚ there's no importance of massaging here‚ you see. And don't ask a non Sahaja Yogi to massage you. Never. Don't allow anybody to touch you that way. Because‚ you see‚ these people carry all bad vibrations and you may suffer. You must allow only the realized souls to massage you‚ if possible‚ or you‚ yourself should massage yourself. But don't go to this masseurs and people who are massaging all kinds of people and they might be given you some troubles.

So‚ one has to be very careful about certain things and certain person habits also‚ which we have discussed. And you can ask Warren‚ he will tell you about it‚ which are very important for Mooladhara and all those things‚ which must be followed‚ whether you are in England‚ America‚ anywhere. This must be followed to keep yourself clean outside and inside. Now‚ if you have any questions?
Sahaja Yogi: I was only wondering‚ Mataji‚ any kind of technique that we should do when massaging the children? But I guess that [unclear].
Shri Mataji: I mean any way you use is all right‚ but always put it a upwards‚ you see‚ The movement should be upward but use oil‚ otherwise you pull out their hair. So‚ use oil to put it up first.
Sahaja Yogi: And don't forget the Sahasrara.
Shri Mataji: Sahasrara don't forget‚ Sahasrara you must put lot of oil on children.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother we're going to a need more hairdressers‚ people who can cut hair for us‚ realized souls‚ because they have us touching on our Sahasrara with the haircut.
Shri Mataji: Yes‚ otherwise you can grow‚ what's the harm?
Sahaja Yogi: We can grow our hair Mother?
Shri Mataji: Yes‚ here up to here you can grow and cut them round. See‚ you'll look like a philosopher‚ quite impressive. But you should not be a funny looking person‚ or a jocular personality. That's one thing very important‚ you see‚ you have not to adopt some funny methods‚ you see‚ like people have. Especially nowadays‚ the fashion is to dishevel you hair and keep them absolutely dishevelled. There is no need to…
Sahaja Yogi: Tell them to keep the hair out of the [unclear].
Sahaja Yogi: The hair must be off the forehead.

Shri Mataji: Yes! Should be kept back over the forehead. Don't cover your forehead‚ or your eyes – never.
Sahaja Yogi: And also‚ the Agnya chakra will stay back.
Shri Mataji: Yes. You must keep it open‚ you see‚ always open. Parted. You must have a central part‚ if is possible‚ but keep the forehead open – it's important. Keep the forehead open – it's very good for others‚ you see‚ and don't cover your eyes with any hair. Many people have a habit of allowing the hair to come on the eyes‚ and you'll have squints.

Children also‚ never allow hair to come on their eyes. Then we have some things for the eyes also‚ what you call 'Neetranjan' – I don't have now anything. But is a very good simple thing‚ cost you nothing‚ about [Neetranjan] is just ten-eleven rupee‚ meaning how much here? One tenth of a dollar. All right‚ they have some‚ they'll give you‚ each is to be applied first very carefully If you are not use to it‚ it will little bit burn and the tears will start coming out of your eyes. It will clear your eyes. And you'll be surprised with that‚ if you use it‚ you don't develop these bags and things like that. And the water closes out – is very simple thing. And for soap also‚ try to use natural soaps. Better is – because here the soaps are such‚ that I don't know what to say.

Sahaja Yogi: Palmolive‚ Mother. 'Palmolive' I think is about the only soap you can get here. Shri Mataji: Yes‚ that is good‚ Palmolive. It's very good. Now‚ what else?

Sahaja Yogi: Jerusalem.
Sahaja Yogi: Mother‚ I have one question here.
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Sahaja Yogi: Another question. My son has [unclear] it's fluid in the ears.

Sahaja Yogi: Her son gets fluid in the ears. What can he do?
Shri Mataji: All right‚ what you do it's to take a little oil and heat with some cloves. Cloves? Sahaja Yogi: Cloves. S
hri Mataji: Cloves‚ cloves.
Sahaja Yogi: No‚ cloves.
Shri Mataji: Cloves. And let the oil be little bit cooled down. When is quite cooled down‚ not‚ should not be burning hot at all‚ but just warm – you can feel it – then put it in the ears.

Sahaja Yogi: Olive oil?
Shri Mataji: Olive oil is all right. But do it quite often. So‚ what happens‚ that the oil goes inside and the fluid comes out.
Sahaja Yogi: Mother‚ could you explain to them the significance of vibrated sugar and vibrated salt and that giving vibrations to these things. They don't quite understand the significance of vibrating everything.
Shri Mataji: You see‚ because God has given you vibrations‚ the power is flowing through you now. The vibrations are there. So‚ whatever you get from outside is touched by so many people‚ so many people have created it and they haven't got a good mind or maybe something wrong with them. Best thing is to give them a bandhan before eating.

Any food you eat‚ you must give the bandhan like this‚ three times‚ so your vibrations flow into the food and you get it sanctified. Or else‚ you can also use your hands for eating. If you have washed your hands then it's all right. Or else‚ if you are taking the water‚ you can just put your hands – then it gets vibrated‚ then drink it.
Because‚ the thing is‚ the vibrations have starting flowing through your hands but still have not spread to your body fully.",https://https://www.amruta.org/p/12484,,,,Treatments,Left side ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That is the love that is the‚ like the sap‚ as I always say‚ that runs in the tree. It gives nourishment to the roots‚ then to all parts of the tree‚ and then it evaporates or it goes down.

Supposing it gets stuck into one flower‚ what will happen that the tree will die‚ and ultimately the flower will also die.

So our love is not limited love. Like‚ we love our children‚ all right‚ [we] love other children also. Everybody is absolutely in full pure love with each other.

Now‚ one must understand the pure love‚ that it is not attached to anyone‚ but at the same time‚ it is pure love. If you don't have pure love in your heart because the culture is different‚ people start moving their attention and spoiling their attention.

So‚ so many people asked Me: ""Mother‚ what to do?"" I said: ""Keep your eyes only up to three feet‚ so you will see beautiful things‚ like you will see flowers‚ you will see children‚ and nothing horrible"". So‚ whatever makes your attention disturbed‚ try to avoid. Best is to concentrate on your meditation.

Then‚ if thoughtless awareness is established by looking at the photograph‚ close your eyes.

Now‚ some people say: ""Mother‚ my heart is not open"". All right. So you can say‚ looking at the Mother: ""Mother‚ please‚ come in my heart."" Somebody's Sahasrara is not open. Then you have to say: ""Mother‚ please come in my head"". With both the hands.

Whatever portion you think in the body is not doing well‚ I am always available‚ so you can ask.

Your meditation should be good‚ first and foremost. If you are good Sahaja Yogis‚ then only others will believe you. But if you are not good Sahaja Yogis‚ nobody will believe you.

For so many people I have seen I am something beyond them. But Sahaja Yogis are the ones which really make them feel that ""these are extraordinary people"".

Then‚ after that‚ dealing with them as I said‚ has to be absolutely with pure attention.

To begin with‚ the men should deal only with men and the women should deal only with women and no complications should come out.

Because that is the biggest blemish Sahaja Yoga can have‚ that they are just like ordinary people. So‚ you have to be careful about yourself.

Before sleeping‚ if you have time‚ you must do footsoaking. If one day you do not do it‚ don't torture yourself for that‚ but it's better that you do footsoaking. And in footsoaking first of all you must know what sort of a personality you have. Mostly you are right-sided‚ mostly.

So put [your] right hand towards the photograph‚ both the feet in the water with little salt and left hand like that.

But some are left-sided‚ some are definitely very much. They should not touch water. Two types of Treatments are there.

Especially left-sided people should not soak‚ should not use ice.

This is all right-sided treatment.

After doing your right-sided or left-sided treatment‚ I would say you put both your hands towards the photograph and see for yourself how it is working out‚ without water‚ without candle.

But I would again say that right-sided people should not use candle as far as possible. This electricity is all right‚ you can use it.

They should not sit in the sun‚ they should put ice on their liver; also they can put ice here [left temple] when it is very hot‚ it's very good to put ice here. Also for diabetes you can put the ice here [Shri Mataji puts her hand on Nabhi].

In Sahaja Yoga the treatment is very simple: for right-sided people very simple‚ and for left-sided.

Right-sided people get problems like liver‚ diabetes‚ blood cancer‚ kidney coagulation‚ that means they can't pass urine‚ constipation‚ also asthma‚ heart attack – massive‚ and also paralysis‚ on the Right side; so many.

Now‚ the left-sided people get pain all over Left side; also can get all kinds of psychosomatic diseases which are not curable‚ like cancer‚ myelitis‚ Parkinson's‚ all kinds.

But if you do your meditation every day‚ once in a while you may miss it‚ it doesn't matter‚ you will immediately feel that you are completely cured and you keep good health.

That's the only way you can grow. And try to bring the point where you are thoughtlessly aware.

The best way to be thoughtless is to say the mantra of Nirvichara. That's very important. And secondly‚ to go on for forgiving: ""I forgive everyone‚ I forgive everyone"" so the thoughts will stop. That is the time when you are in the present. That is the time really you will grow in spirituality.",https://www.amruta.org/p/7143,,Nirvichara Samadhi,,Treatments,,Right side ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17000,,,Balancing the Right side & raise Kundalini,"So now let us give ourselves a nice bandhan. In the bandhan of Mother let us move our left to the right. One‚ nicely‚ understanding what you are‚ what are your auras. Now again‚ second one. Now the third one. Now the fourth one. Now the fifth. Now the sixth one. And now the seventh.
Now raise your Kundalini. Raise your Kundalini‚ slowly‚ very slowly. Raise it‚ first time you have to do it very slowly. Now push back your heads‚ and give it a knot‚ one knot.
Second one‚ let's do it‚ very slowly and knowing what you are‚ you're a saint. Do it‚ properly‚ properly‚ do it properly‚ not in a haste. Take it to your head‚ push back your head and give it two knots there‚ one and two.
Now let's do the other one. Again‚ the third one we have to give three knots. Very slowly do it‚ very slowly. Now‚ do it properly. Now push back your head‚ now give it the third one‚ three times.
Now see your vibrations.
See your vibrations like this.
All the children‚ see your vibrations like this. Put your hand [straight]
All right? Good.
The steps [unsure] done it.
Beautiful. I am getting vibrations from you.
May God bless you!

17010,,,Cleaning the Left side or Right side,"So‚ one thing is to develop quality you have to meditate. That I said. But you must know what is your problem. You are right-sided or left-sided. It's very important to know whether you are right-sided or left-sided. Now some people have problems which are left-sided. All right‚ they start doing water treatment. There was doctor in Delhi‚ Dr. Nigam‚ you must be knowing him. He had‚ I had cured his paralysis. I was surprised that his left hand was still not working out properly.

So I asked him‚ ""What sort of a meditation you do?""

He said‚ ""With the light and with the water.""

I said‚ ""What? You are doing both?""

""Yes.""

I said‚ ""What‚ what's wrong with you is Right side [Shri Mataji corrects] – Left side. So you should just do candle treatment. Just drop it."" I said it to him. Just when I said it to him‚ his hand started opening out. I said it only; becomes like a mantra I think. Started opening‚ he has opened his hand.

So about treatment also you must understand what treatment you must take. Now some people are left-sided. They should take Left side treatment only. There should be no confusion.

So I said‚ ""Who told you this?""

He said‚ ""Everybody said the same thing.""

I said‚ ""What did they say?""

""That you can take this.""

In Sahaja Yoga there are certain rules and regulations of the Divine. So now if you are suffering from the left‚ you just take treatment for left. No water treatment‚ at all. Now you are suffering from the right‚ then don't take the candle treatment at all‚ at all. These are two sides which are to be corrected‚ then you are in the center.

When you feel you are in center‚ you can use both the things. But that is normally very few‚ I've seen. Normally you find very few people who have this central point. If they have‚ they should do this treatment. But there is no need to do treatment once you are in the center. But you have to meditate. So you can sit before the photograph. But to take out all your conditionings and things‚ or may be the day's problem‚ you can sit before the photograph with a candle as well as water. But the ones who are not‚ should not. And one should not feel also bad if the leaders tell them‚ ""You are left-sided or right-sided."" ",https://www.amruta.org/p/6446,,,,Treatments,,Right side ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17020,,,Treating mental & emotional problems and stress-related conditions,"We have to look after ourselves in a way that we should keep good health. And to keep good health in Sahaja Yoga‚ there are thousand and one things‚ which you have to know‚ which is very easy to understand‚ and which will be told to you for no price at all‚ nothing. It is the Divine that is anxious that you should get it‚ that you should settle down‚ that you should enjoy it. So‚ you don't have to be so anxious about it. These anxieties must be given up‚ just try to understand your centers.
Now many of you did feel the cool breeze. But maybe‚ after some time‚ you may lose it‚ doesn't matter. You'll go up and down‚ like that‚ doesn't matter. It does not mean that you've lost it‚ not at all.
Now supposing you try a method‚ a simple method‚ that you first put your left hand towards my photograph – just now you can try – and right hand on the Mother Earth‚ let's see.

Right hand on the Mother Earth‚ that's why I wanted to have it in the open‚ but doesn't matter now‚ if rain is good for you‚ for the farmers‚ let's have it.
So‚ now put your left hand like this‚ and right hand – those who are sitting can put up like that [towards the sky]. Like this. Back [the palm towards the back]. Yes. Right hand like this‚ right. Not left‚ right hand.
Sahaja Yogi: It's on the ground. No‚ like this.
Shri Mataji: Backwards‚ yes‚ right hand.
Now what we are doing‚ the left-hand side power‚ is the emotional power. Now if you have an emotional problem – say‚ somebody has been taking drugs‚ he's a left-sided person. Some drugs are- LSD and all that- right-sided‚ but most of the drugs take you to the Left side. Gurus are Left sided problem. Most of these problems are mental problems‚ are left-sided problems. But the problem of the intellectuals is Right sided‚ futuristic people is Right sided. People who are running the rat race are Right sided‚ you see‚ that kind of over activity‚ that kind of things. On the contrary‚ those who have taken to drugs are Left sided.
So‚ first try with the left‚ let's see.

Now put your right hand on the Mother Earth. Put your right hand on the Mother Earth.
Now‚ put your left hand towards Me.
Gradually‚ you'll find it will start flowing in your left hand. Is it flowing?
Put your right hand on the Mother Earth‚ because the Mother Earth takes away. You see‚ you are just earthing it‚ put it on it‚ touch it‚ touch‚ touch it‚ you see‚ you are earthing yourself‚ is a very simple thing.
Now Left sided problems easily go to Mother Earth‚ it's true‚ but the best is to have a light. Now‚ say‚ if you have a candle‚ candle is the best‚ for left-sided problems‚ candle is the best thing to take it. Because Left sided problems‚ we can say‚ are cold problems‚ or problems which arise from coldness. You see‚ a person who becomes inactive.
Now see.
You just put your left hand towards me like this and right hand towards a candle.

You 'll be amazed‚ sometimes‚ the candle starts burning ""tac"" and drop like that and sometimes it creates such black smoke that‚ if it is next to a wall‚ you might find the whole wall becoming black. It's very interesting to see how the candle reacts‚ but you must have a photograph in front. And there should be a candle before the photograph and one candle like this to take it out.
Like that. Now‚ see‚ better? All right?

You'll feel it's going down. You'll feel from your head‚ you'll feel‚ you see‚ the pressure is going down.
Better now? Like this. Put the hand like that‚ like back side‚ not towards me‚ like that yes‚ yes. Now. Hum. Now put left hand‚ if you 're sitting on the ground‚ it's better to put towards me‚ left hand.
It's coming‚ it's going‚ it's working.
It's like the energy‚ you see‚ that is coming through the photograph‚ it's pushing it down towards the light‚ and the light burns it off. Light gets awakened‚ by you. It's surprising but it does.
It's better now? See. We work out‚ you'll feel it. You will feel it yourself‚ there is nothing to certify. You will feel yourself. Put your left hand towards me‚ left hand towards me like this‚ yes. You all will feel it yourself.
Now people who have been to gurus‚ who have sort of schizophrenic attitude‚ who are moody people‚ frantic‚ fits‚ they get all sorts of these‚ to extreme to the least you see‚ who are emotional‚ some women who cry too much‚ hysterics‚ all those things can be controlled by this simple method of putting left hand towards the photograph and right hand towards a candle.

See‚ it's working out?
You'll feel the movement in your head you'll feel‚
Sahaja Yogi: Yes‚
Shri Mataji: Feeling it now.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: No?
Sahaja Yogi: So‚ it's not there.
Shri Mataji: Now with the right-hand now.

Those who are running the rat race‚ you see big people who think they must earn money and all‚ they are running in the politics and all that kind of a – another madness they have. You see‚ that's also a kind of madness‚ you see. [Shri Mataji laughs]
So‚ for such people who are having a high blood pressure because of that‚ they will have diabetes‚ they'll have liver troubles. Now even for any organ‚ you see‚ any organ you take‚ say heart‚ in Sahaja Yoga we have for every organ‚ two types of nature. One is the one that is lethargic and another that is overactive.
So‚ supposing you are an overactive person‚ then if you are an overactive person‚ you are studying very hard or thinking about the future or planning something‚ then‚ you have a heart which is overactive. Or you have an intestine which is overactive. Your liver is overactive‚ the all system is overactive‚ you'll have high blood pressure and all the problems of high blood pressure‚ constipation‚ all these things go hand in hand in one personality.

Then‚ another personality could be a lethargic. A person who has a lethargic heart‚ may get a- has to get a bypass or something like that‚ because the heart doesn't pump. You may have a lethargic intestine‚ such a person might – whatever he eats just goes to the bathroom‚ sort of a thing or may be a lethargic liver. When you have a lethargic liver then you might get allergies. Allergies are caused by lethargic liver.
But‚ if you are an overactive person‚ if you are overactive‚ then the same liver which was giving you these allergies‚ will give you nausea‚ a feeling of a sickness‚ migraine‚ and vomiting‚ big emesis.
So‚ there are two types of livers also. We have two types of kidneys‚ two types of‚ everything is two types.

So‚ if you are a lethargic person‚ if you have a lethargic problem‚ then what you have to do is to use the light. For all the lethargic troubles‚ best is the light‚ to use the light for lethargic troubles‚ this is Left side.
And for the Right sidedness‚ you can use the Mother Earth. Mother Earth is the best or water and salt. So‚ water and salt is very good for people who are suffering from an over-activity. Now how do you do it? It's good for both‚ but specially for them. Like you have to put both the hands first towards the photograph‚ put both the feet in the water‚ with little salt.
Now if you are feeling the vibrations coming in both the hands‚ equally the same‚ it's all right‚ you don't have to worry. But supposing‚ one hand is more and one hand is less. The hand that is less has to go before the photograph‚ always. The hand that is less has to go towards the photograph and another one has to go out. And you'll be amazed‚ the movement of the thing‚ you will feel within yourself these balloons [of ego and superego] will be moving like that [from right to left and from left to right]. And you can feel it‚ that something is moving in your head‚ you are getting relaxed.
And gradually‚ you'll become a master‚ you will know how to handle this body‚ absolutely‚ you'll become a master. And when you become master – people have become masters in eight days‚ in eight days. Once you become a master‚ then you can handle other bodies also and help other people. It's as simple as that.
So‚ forget about the past‚ now the present‚ we have to be in the present.",https://www.amruta.org/p/7219,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17030,,,Workshop with yogis," So‚ first is Self-realization‚ means you know yourself. Once you know yourself‚ you start knowing others‚ because we are all collectively conscious. Those who are Realized souls become aware of others.
So‚ first of all‚ if you want to see your own vibrations‚ you have to put yourself into bandhan like this‚ as I told you‚ like this.
Now‚ let's do it.

Put your left hand towards Me.
Sahaja Yogi: Like this towards Shri Mataji and the other hand goes over in the outside. So you go over once‚ back over the top‚ twice‚ three times‚ four times‚ five time six times and seven and that sticks your vibrations.
[Shri Mataji open both the hands‚ palms upward]
Shri Mataji: Now‚ these are your vibrations‚ whatever it is‚ now check‚ see now. Which finger is burning? See‚ carefully.
Now this is Left Nabhi. Now which one is burning‚ be careful.
Pay attention.
Shri Mataji: Which one? Which one?
Seeker: This place.
Shri Mataji: Here? [Mother shows the right hand] Maybe he is constipated‚ is he? Does he get constipation?
Seeker: He has been thinking a lot of these things.
Shri Mataji: Yes‚ it's the liver‚ sign of liver‚ you see‚ and also constipated. So‚ he is more a Right sided person‚ because the Right side is this thing. So‚ he has to put left to the right‚ like this. All right?

Seeker: I'm just warm and sticky‚ what could that mean?
Shri Mataji: You have a heart [problem]
Seeker: That's all I have.
Shri Mataji: You put your right hand on your heart.

Seeker lady: My hand is rather warm.
Shri Mataji: Warm? All right‚ doesn't matter‚ and the other one?
Seeker lady: Nothing.
Shri Mataji: Nothing. All right. So‚ put your left to the right. Left to the right. [Shri Mataji is doing a bandhan from the left to the right]
Sahaja Yogi: You take it- when She says left to the right‚ what you're doing is not just this one‚ but you are actually‚ lifting the Left side.
Shri Mataji: And taking the grace from the right.
Sahaja Yogi: And you come across‚ you lift the Left side again‚ because you're balancing
Shri Mataji: And taking the grace‚ you see‚ on the Right side‚ because Right side is showing nothing. If the Right side is showing nothing‚ then what you are doing‚ you are lifting your left which is slightly showing and you take up and bring it down‚ with your right hand. Left to the right.
Sahaja Yogi: If you got problems on the Right side‚ if you got problems in your right fingers‚ any of them of your hand‚ you take from the Left side‚ and over the top and you bring down the grace into the Right side.
OK. Then it's the opposite‚ that's as simple as that.

Shri Mataji: If she's not- if you are not feeling at all on right hand‚ then you have right hand problem. You're not feeling any vibrations‚ hum?
Seeker: Not this one.
Shri Mataji: And left hand‚ you are feeling what?
Sahaja Yogi: Slightly warm on the Left side. This finger.
Shri Mataji: It's a combination of these.
So‚ he has to go from right to left. Right to left.
Seeker lady: We try with hands. [Unsure]
Sahaja Yogi: Just do it yourself now‚ get into balance that's the object of what Shri Mataji is saying.

Seeker lady: Can we change hands?
Shri Mataji: Yes‚ you can‚ you change hands‚ yes. Better.

Sahaja Yogi: Just to repeat it again‚ if you've got abnormal sensations‚ heat or something in your right hand‚ that means there's some damage on that side. So‚ you lift the Left side and you bring down the grace into the Right side. Just do that if you've got that problem.
Shri Mataji: Right to the left.
You take your right hand and put it like that.
Sahaja Yogi: If you've got it in the other direction‚ you change hands as She said and you go the other way. It's as simple as that‚ until it balances‚ until it works out. Keep doing it until it works out.
Shri Mataji: Did you come to my program before?
Seeker: No.
Shri Mataji: No‚ that's why. Just it has started‚ you see‚ you have to get your Realization first of all‚ all right? You come here. We'll have to work it out‚ first of all‚ as your Realization has not worked out‚ that's why. It just started. Hum? Let it work out. If the Realization works out‚ then only you can feel it properly. That's why.
[Aside] Right side‚ not at all‚ so I was wondering why.
Are you feeling? Good. Left hand‚ what are you feeling? Cool breeze in the left hand.
Seeker lady: Yes.
Shri Mataji: And not on the right. All right. So‚ what you do is to take left to the right.
No‚ with the right hand.
Seeker lady: Oh‚ yes.
Shri Mataji: Gradually when you'll practice you will know.

Better now? Good? Good. He's all right.

Shri Mataji: Are you all right? How are you feeling?
Yes?
Sahaja Yogi: Left hand? She is asking‚ you get heat on the Left side or on the left hand?
Shri Mataji: You can get it on the left hand or Left side anywhere. Where are you getting?
Sahaja Yogi: She says she is getting on the right hand.
Shri Mataji: Yes‚ you can get it on both the sides. Are you getting on right? Then you put your left to the right.
No‚ no‚ no‚ no‚ no‚ left hand towards Me and right hand like this. Like this. Just raise it and bring it down like this. Don't go back.
Better.
Sahaja Yogi: Down. And again‚ and down. And again‚ and down. And again‚ and down. Now‚ try.

Shri Mataji: Yes‚ what? Yes‚ correct.
On the right hand? Left to the right. Left to the right. No‚ no‚ no‚ left. Left to the right.
Sahaja Yogi: Is there anyone that still doesn't understand.
Seeker lady: I feel it with both hands now.
Shri Mataji: Good. Both the hands cool?
Seeker lady: No‚ there's still a tingling.
Shri Mataji: In which hand?
[Cut in the video]

Sahaja Yogi: The left hand to Mother?
Shri Mataji: No‚ no. Look at Me. Left hand to Me‚ like this. And now right hand you pick it up from here and push it down.
Sahaja Yogi: Keep doing until it disappears.
Shri Mataji: He is all right. You're all right.
What about you? Feeling cool breeze in both the hands‚

Sahaja Yogi: Keep your attention steady.
Seeker lady: I feel more balance in my hands.
Shri Mataji: Hum‚ balance‚ yes. You start feeling the balance‚ that's the best way.

Seeker lady: Madame‚ I feel very hot [inaudible].
Shri Mataji: You have a Vishuddhi that means‚ doesn't matter. You put your left hand at the back of your chakra here [the neck]. And put your right hand towards Me‚ right hand.

Shri Mataji: What about you? Are you feeling? Nothing? You never felt any cool breeze? Surprising. You come from which state? UP?
[Hindi conversation] Just see if there is any cool breeze coming from his head. [Hindi conversation] Ask some gentleman to give vibrations on his Vishuddhi‚ put the hand on his Vishuddhi.

Are you all right?
Seeker: I'm just getting hot from massage.
Shri Mataji: All right. Put right [towards the sky]
You are feeling hot too?
Shri Mataji: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: All right. Doesn't matter.
How are you feeling now?
Seeker lady: When you are balancing yourself‚ how long does that type of things take?
Shri Mataji: A split of a second.
Seeker lady: How long will it last‚ balancing yourself?
Sahaja Yogi: How long will the balancing last you?
Shri Mataji: Last? I mean there is no timing for it. It can last you forever‚ but if you are a very wobbly type‚ it may a little bit drop on‚ but you have to know how to do it‚ you see? Now‚ we can say we are driving a car. Now‚ how long will it last there? As long as you keep it. You are driving this car [Shri Mataji shows Her body] all right?
Now‚ what is it? Are you feeling the balance now?
Seeker lady: I? Yes.
Shri Mataji: Good‚ then it's good.
Sahaja Yogi: When it becomes imbalanced‚ that's when you correct it.
Seeker lady: So‚ just through the day‚ you just have to-
Shri Mataji: No‚ no‚ no‚ no‚ no‚ no. Now‚ if you're in balance‚ there is nothing wrong‚ it's all right‚ perfectly all right.

Sahaja Yogi: Can you get it when you haven't had the Realization. You mean the balancing?
Shri Mataji: Have you got your Realization?
That is the first‚ that's the first thing. Otherwise you have not entered into the kingdom of God‚ isn't it? First thing is to have your Realization. And then‚ now‚ put your hands towards Me. Yes.
Sahaja Yogi: Everybody should do that because the more you put your hands to Mother‚ the stronger the vibrations will flow. Take this chance because it had to develop. And just sit. It might be little uncomfortable but just keep your hands to Mother  ...""",https://www.amruta.org/p/7219,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

17050,,,Discipline in Meditation ,"So Ashram is here for a collective living‚ but collective living of spirituality. It's not just living here‚ but it is of spirituality. And we have to know certain things about the discipline that we have to keep‚ is very important. It's not just a house where are… some people have gathered together to live together‚ but it has to have a discipline. Then only you'll be helped – because if you do not come to the Ashram with this idea that you are going there to ascend yourself‚ it will make no difference whether you stay in the house or you go in the Ashram.

So there are two types of meditation‚ two types‚ where one is the meditation where‚ we can call it the ""antar mana"" [inside view]‚ that we meditate inside ourselves. To see for ourselves what's wrong with us‚ and how we have to correct‚ what we have to do about it. And another is ""bahir mana"" [outside view]‚ is outside‚ how we have to live outside. You have to have a discipline‚ which is not imposed on you but‚ very happily‚ which you have accepted and have imbibed. For any art‚ say in India‚ I don't know here‚ but you have to put yourself into a rigorous training to achieve any height. You cannot haphazardly move about it. You cannot take just easily everything. In Sahaja Yoga there is no tapascharya [asceticism]‚ there is no penance for you. It's all blessings. But one should not get lost with those blessings if you have to really get into yourself in its full depth.

So‚ for the ""antar mana""‚ it is important that you all should meditate‚ morning and evening‚ every day. Is all right even if you do not brush your teeth‚ but you must meditate is an important thing. That is the reason I find that in the West people go on catching‚ again cleaning‚ again catching. Every time I come… find somebody is suffering from either… for some sort of a conditioning‚ or say‚ some sort of a badha‚ or sometimes it's ego or something. It comes and goes. It is not something that is detached permanently. As we have to take our bath every day‚ we have to wash ourselves every day‚ in the same way we have to wash ourselves within. So meditation is the ""antar mana tapaha""‚ as you can call it‚ but it's not such a ""tapaha"" [pain] even. You don't have to go to Himalayas and sit there. You have to just do this meditation early in the morning.

In the Sahaja Yoga system‚ I would say the best that is working out is in Germany and in Austria‚ these two; and also England‚ but not to that extent. I would say these two are working out the best; and thirdly‚ in Rome.

They too have ashrams of the same kind‚ but for them‚ it is very important to achieve the heights of Sahaja Yoga. Absolutely. Nothing is more important.

Invariably‚ in all these ashrams‚ I've seen people get up at four o'clock. I also get up every day at four. Then I may sleep later on‚ but at four o'clock I am up. They take their baths‚ get ready for the pujas‚ and then sit down and do about five‚ ten minutes puja of the photograph‚ and then meditate. Then they go and have some breakfast or something. Then when they come home from work‚ also they sit down together to meditate‚ that's the collective part of it‚ or discuss whatever is to be done‚ what‚ how are we to propagate Sahaja Yoga. They just talk about Sahaja Yoga‚ or they decide what should be done‚ what is the best way to solve the problems of Sahaja Yoga. And then in the night‚ before sleeping‚ invariably all of them‚ all of them‚ one and all‚ even children before sleeping‚ soak their feet in the water‚ sit for meditation‚ and sleep. That's why I find Austria has come up so well‚ and Germans. You know‚ Germans are like that. If something gets into their heads‚ for them that's the most important thing; then they do not sort of fickle out. There's no… they don't have any compromises on those points. And they make their body work hard.

Now‚ what is the Tapa in this thing here – the penance?  That our body is used to some sort of a life. India also‚ we are all like that in India – everybody will get up in the morning‚ and they will sit for puja‚ or they will sit for meditation. I mean‚ that goes without saying‚ you don't have to tell them. Because that's the traditional thing to do in India: always when they get up‚ have their bath‚ they always do some puja‚ all of them. If they're Christians‚ also‚ they'll sit down and pray. Muslims‚ they'll do Namaaz. That's a kind of a practice‚ and the breeding of the family.

Here I find that the parents do not take the responsibility to pass on any information to children about disciplining themselves‚ because children are also extremely aggressive. They don't want to know about it. So the parents also dare not tell them that: ""It is good for you‚ please do it this way; it is better that you meditate."" They're afraid that they may lose their children if they tell them like this. Or‚ ""You pray""‚ or ""You get up at this time""‚ you dare not tell them that you get up at this time. This is the greatest crime in the West‚ if you tell them that: ""You have to get up at four o'clock"" – abbah! It's like the worst punishment. But once you start getting up in the morning‚ you'll get the habit‚ and then you'll sleep early. Then you can sleep early. Getting up in the morning‚ really‚ will help you for the whole day. So start this kind of a practice.

You must meditate every day‚ and this is the reason why I find people‚ whenever I come‚ they're again caught up‚ something has gone wrong. This is wrong‚ that is wrong; they're caught up here and there. Why should you? Day by day‚ you must rise. Day by day‚ you should be at a much higher state‚ and this new breeding has to come within us‚ that we are Sahaja Yogis. And we are not here only‚ just to have good food and to have a nice time or nice meetings‚ but we are here to become those unique personalities‚ which are required to raise the humanity to a higher state. So you have to be‚ now‚ responsible for yourself. You have to look after yourself and you have to tell yourself: ""Mr. So-and-so‚ Mrs. So-and-so‚ please now behave yourself."" Otherwise‚ Sahaja Yoga is lost to you. It's not going to help you much. We might increase in quantity‚ but quality-wise we'll be missing; and one attack of negativity can finish such a quantity that we think is too much – it has happened once.

So now‚ all of you must develop that dedication to yourself‚ to find out what's your problem‚ and how you have to correct it. If it is done every day‚ I can assure you‚ you will have no problem of any kind. Your thoughts will stop‚ your problems will be solved‚ and you'll have no catches at all because you've washed them off. But if you leave them on your being‚ then they grow‚ and they become big. So there should be no lethargy‚ as far as meditation is concerned‚ but joyfully you'll start doing‚ after some time. You won't be happy if you have not done it. But in the beginning you'll have to goad yourself‚ and tell yourself that this body has to be cleaned; but more than that body‚ this mind and intellect‚ both of them‚ are to be corrected.",https://www.amruta.org/p/2874,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

17070,,,"""See trough your vibrated awareness""","Shri Mataji: You see‚ in Sahaja Yoga‚ you are not given any mantra or anything. There's no‚ nothing like giving you into a big course‚ like teaching you one after another any mantra‚ or anything‚ it's not like that.
What you have to know: where the Kundalini is‚ how it is moving‚ where it is‚ what is the charka catching and what is the mantra for that. It doesn't take anything‚ hardly it takes about a week for you to understand the all thing. But gradually‚ as you start using it‚ you become proficient and you how to do it for yourself and for others. There is not much of a thing- like a child‚ when he comes up a little age‚ he starts speaking up language‚ because he has a built-in capacity to create sounds. And he does it. In the same way‚ once you get it‚ when you get the cool breeze in you hand‚ you learn it by using it‚ you understand it yourself‚ you become yourself quite proficient. And you will be amazed how fast you learn this. You don't have to learn it just like a science book or anything‚ you just start learning‚ you can: this is charka which is catching because now‚ say‚ for example‚ this charka is catching [fore finger]‚ Right side. Now‚ there's a mantra for this is of Shri Krishna. Say‚ this charka is catching [forehead]‚ here‚ then there's a mantra of Jesus Christ. Like that‚ you must know the mantras and the charkas. But the charkas you just know as a‚ absolutely‚ a knowledge which is built-in your nerves: you just feel it.
This is- now this gentleman is saying: "" it's hot here"" [left palm]. Alright‚ what is that? Hot here means what? That's the Sahasrara‚ at the Left side. First it was‚ the Sahasrara on the Right side. Now‚ on the Left side it's there. So that means there's a mantra for that‚ and that one must be used. If you use that mantra‚ this will be cleared out. Alright? That is how you have to know. And that's why I said it takes time for people sometimes to establish‚ because first you have to know it and then use it.

Shri Mataji: Come along. Have you come for the first time?
Seeker: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: All right‚ come along. Come along this side.

Shri Mataji: So‚ it is not a difficult thing‚ it is not at all a difficult thing to learn it‚ it's very easy. You can pick it up in no time‚ as soon as you start using your hands on other people.

Shri Mataji: Please‚ be seated. Alright.
[To a Yogi] Just see them‚ some people come along.

Now these people‚ say- who are the latest who have come to Sahaja Yoga? Let's see. The latest ones. Say‚ those who have come about a month back.
Seeker: Yes.
Shri Mataji: See‚ he came back‚ she came back only one month back. And.
Sahaja Yogini: This is his first time.
Seeker: I was here on Monday.
Shri Mataji: How much?
Sahaja Yogini: Ah. Ok‚ he was here on Monday.
Shri Mataji: Monday‚ alright. He's got it.
But you see‚ [to someone else] Have you been giving vibrations now?
Lady: Yes.
Shri Mataji: In one month‚ it's done. So you can imagine. And you know about the charkas now?
Lady: Yes.
Shri Mataji: About the mantras?
Lady: Yes. Not all of them.
Shri Mataji: Yes‚ you see‚ that's it. It's very simple.
If you pay attention to it‚ you can do it much faster. There are many people who are here‚ within a month‚ one month's time‚ they pick up so many things. Many like that‚ within one month's time. [To a Sahaja Yogi:] He's alright.

Because you become the knowledge. You start feeling it on your fingers‚ you know this is the charka. If this finger is‚ say‚ burning‚ [left auricular] that means your left heart is catching. If your left heart is catching‚ then you know because it's burning! Then‚ there's nothing to go to the books or anything to find out‚ it's just burning‚ it's there. Isn't it? That means the left heart is catching. Now‚ only you have to know what [Inaudible] left heart is catching‚ the decoding only‚ what does that mean.
Your hands will speak Christ has said‚ alright? They will speak‚ I am just recording it. Now you see for self if it's true or not. What does that mean? Left heart means there's a problem on the heart: may be‚ the person is over hard working‚ he has forgotten about his Spirit. The mantra you have to say is: ""I am the Spirit""‚ for left heart.
It's so simple. Because you have forgotten about your Spirit‚ you are more on the Right side in the sense‚ you are more extra- you are an extravert and more attention is outside‚ not towards your Spirit. Left heart is catching.

You start understanding Sahaja Yoga so well when your vibrations are steady. Now this finger‚ this is catching [left thumb]. Now this is catching means the person has been to somebody who s unauthorized in spiritual life. Anything‚ say ISP‚ you call it IST. Then you have got parapsychology‚ even psychology. Then you have got other things like all these gurus‚ false gurus‚ you can say this aura business- what else is there‚ just now he was telling.
Sahaja Yogini: Supernatural‚ Mother.
Shri Mataji: Supernatural and under-natural‚ and [Big laugh]. All these things‚ you know‚ all alternatives you can think of. Anything you can think of‚ all these things and the books‚ and the Lams and the Dhamas‚ and every thing. [Laugh]. Even people who go‚ sort of adhere to a chuch too much‚ or adhere to Catholicism again. Because they are not connected with God and they are unauthorized. [Shri Mataji shows her left palm].
But if you have been to a real guru‚ then immediately I will know. You won't have this problem and ascent will be very fast if you have been to a real guru. But how many are real these days? In the market‚ only those who are marketing are they‚ as I said it: in the market only the buyers and the shopkeepers. It's a market place now!
So the real gurus are not to be seen‚ there are‚ of course I know‚ there are many real gurus also‚ but wherever they are‚ they are not in the market. I am the only person fighting them and telling them off‚ you see. None of them are willing to come down or to concede to anything‚ they said these human beings are hopeless. They said: "" twelve years you work Mother‚ then we'll come down "". They want me alone to fight the [ordeal?] [Shri Mataji laughs] doesn't matter. So now‚ it's a market place‚ where there are buyers and they are simple naïve customers. They just put such absurd things like somebody says: ""alright‚ I want to sell a big palace‚ with this and that‚ and all that‚ only you have to deposit 2 thousand pounds."" Alright‚ people will be quite willing to do: ""Oh‚ what a bargain‚ let's pay 2 thousands."" And the palace may belong to the Queen.
If you go there and ask them: ""which palace you want to sell?"" ""This palace. "" And that belongs to the Queen‚ you see. This is unauthorized. Unauthorized people who have nothing to do with God‚ who claim that they have something to do with God‚ which is false‚ and that's why they catch on this finger [left thumb]. And what do they do? They use all these techniques; these techniques are called‚ in Sanskrit language‚ as ""avidya"". "" Avidya"" means‚ non-knowledge‚ you can say that it's not knowledge‚ something anti-knowledge‚ anti-God‚ this is anti-God. So for that the mantra is: ""Shuddha vidya""‚ means the pure technique. It's the mantra : pure technique‚ it's the mantra. ""Pure"" means the one that comes from the Spirit. Now what they are doing [The Sahaja Yogis] is the pure technique because it's flowing in them. If they are moving their hands‚ there's a power flowing through them and they are working it out. It's not just a‚ acrobatic thing that is going on.
So the pure knowledge: for example‚ the way they are raising theses candles now in my presence‚ and they themselves are Realized souls‚ it's working out. So this is all‚ it' the pure ""vidya"" it's the pure knowledge and the pure technique‚ and those who have not done this‚ have gone to such people‚ they have put their heads before them‚ kneeled before them‚ have done something that should not have been done! So this is it.
And that's how if you catch on this finger‚ this thumb‚ left hand‚ that means a person has been to somebody like that. But‚ with that‚ if you have any catch on this Void [on the palm]‚ or Void here in the stomach part- this is left Swaddithana‚ it's placed here down below‚ which moves like that all over‚ and this becomes right Swaddisthana‚ this side. Now supposing a person catches all round here‚ his Void‚ and all round here.
Seeker: How do you call it?
Shri Mataji: It's called as the Void‚ we call it Void. It's not the Zen Void. But the Void is the crossing point which is‚ it's the viscera‚ it's the stomach part‚ where-abdomen you can call it‚ abdomen part – and this part‚ if it is catching that means these are the ten principles of the guru. If this is catching‚ means you have hurt your principle of guru‚ your principle of a master. That means you have gone to some very wrong master. If this is catching‚ that means that. Now‚ just now as they said‚ his Void is catching. The Kundalini will be wobbling there‚ you can see it with your own eyes also. You can see the Kundalini just potting [?] – pulsating there‚ you can see the all stomach going into a trauma. And then you have to say the mantra of the Primordial master. Anyone you can do it you see‚ Guru Nanaka's name you can take‚ Muhammad's name you can take‚ all of them are Prophets. Moses' name‚ Abraham‚ all these are there. So if you take their names‚ the Kundalini can be brought up. You can strengthen that part‚ then the Kundalini's pushed up.

So all these so-called Yogas‚ also like physical yoga. Now‚ in the physical Yoga‚ you will catch this finger [right annular]‚ this one [right major] and this finger [left auricular]. This ring finger here and this finger [left auricular]. This is heart‚ means you have been paying too much attention to your physical thing. Anybody who is working also physically too much can also catch this‚ plus this [right annular]. Because when you go into action too much‚ also‚ as a result of that‚ the fumes or your actions create your ego. And this is one of the biggest problem of the West you see‚ they are not aware that they have an ego. But after Realization they start seeing the ballon [floating?] like that [Shri Mataji laughs]‚ they see that and then they come and tell me: ""Mother I 'm catching on my right Agnya"" [Right side]. It's a very delicate stuff. You can't tell anybody: ""You have got ego"". They [do really?] have it‚ you see. So you have to be very careful when you are talking to them. But actually‚ so many people felt that there is ego in them‚ so they took to- even people‚ when they feel they have too much ego they take to alcoholism‚ because they are frightened of themselves‚ they can't just bear‚ they want to escape that part. So people are quite conscious.

But after Realization‚ it becomes a complete understanding because you start feeling a little pain sometimes‚ in this finger [right annular]‚ you feel a pain here and you know that you have got this Mister ego just coming out. So then you know how to twist it and take it out‚ how to bring it out. So you start understanding yourself and you start understanding others.
I don't have to tell you‚ you know yourself.

Now we have certain things‚ like we use vibrated water for clearing your Void. Now what is vibrated water? It's nothing that- but these divine vibrations are put into it. And they go and start bombarding that area and try to improve it. We have cured so many people of stomach cancers and all those things with it. Even‚ we can cure what you call blood cancers something with Sahaja Yoga‚ so many have been cured. You can cure‚ you can do it‚ no problem‚ you can do it‚ but‚ what one has to do [is] to be steadily moving about with Sahaja Yoga.

Now for example‚ you have a conception about Christ‚ say for example. Now‚ that conception my not be the real conception of Christ‚ may not be‚ may be. So keep your eyes opened. Now what I say in Sahaja Yoga‚ you can verify it. But do not deny‚ first verify.
Supposing you go as a scientist‚ you have to go and see for yourself‚ isn't it? You just deny [?]""no this cannot be true."" Because whatever you know is your own conception.

Get inside alright. Now when you get inside‚ keep you eyes opened and see for yourself. And then‚ once you start seeing it‚ that's the best way‚ is knowing‚ because what you see is trough your vibrated awareness. For example‚ now you want to ask a question‚ say‚ Mother is there God? Just ask a question thrice and you'll find the vibrations will increase. It's a fact. But if you ask about T.M.‚ you may get even burning. Vibrations will stop. Better ask about God‚ so that we have vibrations. [Laughs] [Shri Mataji is making a bandhan].",https://www.amruta.org/p/9028,,About meditation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17080,,,How to keep the body cool in summer,"Shri Mataji: To keep the body cool in summer first of all you have to do is to take some ice and rub it on your liver‚ keep the liver cool‚ don't think too much. Don't take hot things‚ like in the summer time so many people eat those watermelons and things like that. They should be cooled down properly‚ like even mangos in India must be cooled down and then taken.

All such fruits should be cooled down and then eaten. Some people eat the mangos just from the tree‚ that's very wrong. You have to cool it down for twenty-four hours and then eat it.

This we knew all of us‚ but in modern times I don't know if people don't know.

All these things add up. Then reduce on meats and fish specially. You should not eat fish in the summertime at all. First of all it is spoiled‚ something wrong with it‚ or else it has phosphorous which ignites you.

So‚ avoid all these things‚ eat things which are cool.

Now specially for India it's very easy because we have got something called 'gool khand' which is made out of rose petals which is a very good thing for cooling the liver‚ then cardamom‚ then the candy sugar‚ sugar itself.

All these things will cool down your liver and you'll feel very cool. It's the change in your diet is very important during the summertime.",https://www.amruta.org/p/3853,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17090,,,Allergies,"Now‚ why the child has an allergy?

Now let me ask a question‚ ""Why a child will have an allergy?""

The doctors have to answer. Or‚ of course you are all doctors‚ so you should say. Can I have the answer?

Yogi: Mother‚ it could be an imbalance of heat and cold in the body.

Shri Mataji: But why? Say on the chakras.

You say on the chakras what will be catching. If somebody has allergies‚ what does it catch?

Yogi: Left Nabhi.

Shri Mataji: Correct. Left Nabhi. Left Nabhi will catch. Now‚ that means the mother. Because the child is not yet married‚ so it's the mother.

That means mother must be having a left Nabhi herself‚ and that's why the child must be catching with that allergy. So‚ instead of punishing the child‚ why not cure the left Nabhi of the mother and left Nabhi of the child?

Now what will you do if there's a left Nabhi of the child? What we can do to help the child to get rid of it?

Ah. It's very simple! Anything that is left can be taken out on the little flame. Put your right hand on the left Nabhi of the child and put your left hand to the flame and finished.

Now‚ in diagnosis you are easy‚ but now for medicines – now remember there's certain principles of medicines. Very certain principles are there. If it is Left side‚ you have [to] take it to the fire or to the sun or to the flames‚ all right?

If it is the Left side [could Shri Mataji have meant ""right""?] you have [to] take it to the water in general. Anybody who's suffering from Right side‚ put him in the water‚ finished. Done. Not in the sun of course. Any disease‚ you bring it to this point. It's very simple.",https://www.amruta.org/p/3853,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17100,,,Cleansing the chakras with vibrations by your hands,"How to know where you are‚ as far as God is concerned. That's the main thing‚ isn't it? We are here for that: to be one with God‚ to be [in] union with His Power‚ to be his instruments. And how our connections get loose‚ and how we can to correct it‚ we should try to understand that.

First of all‚ we must realise that you are not to think about it. If you start thinking too much about it‚ then you have seen that you do something funny which you should not have done. Do not plan out too much about it‚ also‚ because‚ in this country‚ if people start planning out‚ they'll get all the planning done. For example‚ they have to go for a walk: then they must have proper shoes‚ they must have proper sticks‚ they must have this‚ they must have that‚ and they must have gloves‚ and they must have everything‚ and they never go out! They are so exhausted with the planning itself. (laughter)

In the same way‚ it happens with Sahaja Yoga. It very much happens the same way with Sahaja Yoga‚ I have seen that though I have told you not to plan it out‚ not to think about it‚ still you go on doing it and that is how you get into problems; that by thinking you cannot correct yourself. What you can do is to know that you can put bandhans or you can give yourself a balance with your hands. You have to move your hands and not your brain. Alright? Our brains are moving and hands and feet never move! And out of proportion our brains are moving but our hands and feet do not move. This is the society which H.G. Wells had described‚ I can see it very clearly‚ that you have more brains than your deftness and than your understanding. Your fingers are not so sensitive and the brain leads you to artificiality. So‚ you are not to use your thinking for correcting your chakras. Now should I write it down in golden words? That‚ ""You cannot think about it and sort it out."" This is one thing people do not understand.

Now we have got mantras for different chakras. Every chakra has got a mantra which you know. If you do not know‚ you should find out. Now‚ if one chakra is catching‚ then you work on that chakra only and develop your mantra on that. For example‚ supposing you have to say something for your heart: then‚ first of all‚ you must ask for forgiveness from God. That means your attention has not been so much as it should have been on the Spirit. Or‚ if you have done any mistakes‚ ask for forgiveness‚ you ask for forgiveness. Now‚ you ask for forgiveness from your heart. Even doing with hand can be artificial‚ you understand that? It could be just ritualistic – but from your heart. Whatever you have to say‚ you say it from your heart. Ask for forgiveness from your heart‚ not [to] think about it. You see‚ this is the trouble is. If I say something then you start thinking about it‚ and then you said then‚ ""Now‚ I have to take out my attention from the centre‚"" and then you start taking out your attention. You cannot. With your brain‚ you cannot take out your attention from anywhere. It's only through your hands‚ or movement of your hands‚ or by saying mantras you bring in. Do you understand that point? Absolutely clear-cut.

Many people think that if they pay attention to something and pull their attention – you cannot. But what you can do is to‚ when you are saying the mantra‚ put your attention‚ without thought‚ to that particular chakra. So you master that chakra ultimately‚ the one which is a weakness can become your mastery. But if you think‚ then you are catching again the heart much more. You have known that by thinking you catch your Right side in the sense that it starts [getting] overactive‚ it gets over-activated‚ and Left side gets frozen up‚ by which heart is catching. Your ego develops which engulfs your heart. So the more you think about it‚ how to correct your ego‚ the worse you are. You fight it.

So then we know that you have to give a balance‚ bring down your ego – with your hand‚ with massaging‚ you can bring it down‚ because in your hand it is flowing‚ whether you are catching or not catching‚ it is flowing from your hand is there – the flow from your hand is there. You may not even receive from Me but there is flow already started‚ it's germinated‚ little bit is always there. Use that to massage your head‚ bring down your ego.

Then for heart also‚ do not think about it but give it‚ or you put your hand towards it. Direct the vibrations but don't think at that time. This is the important thing. If you are thinking and directing‚ it cannot be directed because your attention is engulfed in the thinking process. Do you understand that point? And here‚ the problem is people think too much and talk too much. I mean‚ they talk about everything. They know everything. It is such a wasteful habit of thinking and then talking about it. Everybody is a monarch here because of ego. So now please tell your ego‚ ""You please keep shut – now we know you too well!"" Try to push it back as much as you can‚ with force sometimes‚ bring it back‚ like that. Try to bring it to its normal position and you will be amazed once it goes to its normal position you'll feel very much lighter. So this is to be done with your hand.",https://www.amruta.org/p/5975,,,,Treatments,,Right side ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17110,,,About meditation,"Our whole style sometimes takes us more outward than inside. So let us try to see how we can go inside. I think the only way is to achieve the state of thoughtless awareness‚ through collective living and through meditation‚ individually also: collective and also individual meditation. Try to come to a state where you are thoughtless. Try to put your attention on a thoughtless awareness level‚ then the growth starts‚ because that's the present‚ not the past‚ nor the future.

So‚ if you stop at thoughtless awareness‚ you start seeing something much beyond that exists. Now for example‚ I see these flowers. Just see them. Now what does it relate to me? I should see‚ of course‚ the beautiful colour‚ the fragrance [but] immediately‚ the thought goes to the love‚ with which it is given – immediately. It jumps onto the essence of it. These are not given just for any expression of expectations but just to express the love. And I see that love immediately and that I enjoy. This is‚ a very important point that‚ in thoughtless awareness‚ you immediately jump onto a relationship with love. Say you see the nature around: immediately you feel‚ ""Look at the love of God! How He has created this beautiful world for us. How He has given so many things to us!"" And then this‚ horrible competitiveness just drops out. Because in the present only you can enjoy what you have achieved‚ not in the past or the future.

Say‚ you buy a little carpet like this. You wanted to buy‚ you must have worried about it‚ you must have thought of saving money whatever it is. When you buy it there's no joy. Then you want to buy something else. Like this it goes on. But supposing you are in the present: here now I'm sitting with you in the present. I know all of you‚ very well‚ like a picture. Even the folds of your clothes and everything‚ your sitting position‚ everything is like a picture. And it comes to you and what does it feel? Just like these flowers: a very abstract‚ feeling of joy.

So‚ we should try to live in the present‚ not in the future and in the past.

I've got so many letters of confessions: ""I did this‚ I did that     I mean‚ I never read them‚ never. You should not waste your energy in confessing. That's a wrong thing to do. I don't want to know it. But they send you know for their own‚ maybe‚ satisfaction‚ whatever it is. So doesn't matter. So I just burn them off or tear them out.

So forget the past. That doesn't mean that whatever has built you up to this level‚ you should forget. Whatever has been nourishing‚ your parents and your other relationships‚ your country‚ your reading: anything that has nourished you‚ you must know.
But don't think that‚ ""My childhood was much better or much worse. My mother was bad.""
This is psychology also [which] teaches‚ ""Your mother was bad that's why you are like this"". All blame goes to the mother poor thing! She has given you birth‚ she has looked after you.
But they will blame your mother. Blame the psychologist than the mother‚ that they are putting funny ideas into your heads.

Come inside! There's a lot of space‚ come in! Just come in.

So‚ when you think of your past‚ you have to more deal with the whole thing as if you are there for some sort of a treasure‚ for your nourishment. Not just to blame yourself: ""I did this‚ I took drugs."" It doesn't matter! What is it? Now you solve your problems. ""I did other the things."" Forget it!

When you were in the water‚ in the sea‚ alright you were drowned‚ but you are saved now‚ you are on the shore. What's the use of thinking about what was happening then? It's useless!

But the one who saved you from there‚ or the one‚ the fish that brought you out‚ or whatever it is – those experiences [which] are nourishing you‚ should think of that. Then you won't have this diffidence you won't have this kind of a confused mind‚ but clear cut: ""Now I am different!"" When a fruit comes out of a flower it doesn't think of the flower. In the same way we should not worry about what has gone wrong with us in the past‚ but what has gone good with us we can think of it‚ because that nourishes us.

Now for future also: we have to think about future. But not to extend your projections‚ mental projections. But in meditation you have to see for yourself: ""What is the future for Sahaj Yoga? What can I do? How can I purify myself completely? What have I to do about it?""

In the beginning to get up in the morning was a very difficult task for the Western people. To get up in the morning‚ have baths‚ do meditation‚ is too much! It's a punishment sort of thing. But you're not forced. I mean if you can't get up it's all right. But some started getting up‚ putting their effort. Previous night they would decide‚ ""Now tomorrow whatever may happen I'll get up."" Try! What's the harm? Let's see if it helps you. Also they see somebody getting up in the morning meditating‚ [who is] so different: then they start doing.

The other day I was in Calcutta and there was one gentleman: a very learned lawyer‚ and a chartered accountant. But he had started a factory which was confiscated by the government. And he won the case [but] lost a lot of money winning that case‚ and the compensation has not yet come. It's so many years now‚ about ten years. So I told him divert your attention from there. Get into your own profession that you have. Now he's a multimillionaire! He doesn't bother about the little compensation. He said‚ ""I better compensate the government now!"" He's all right.

So I told him‚ ""How did you achieve it?"" So he said to me that‚ ""I saw another one who was much younger to me who was nothing‚ he was just an ordinary person‚ and he was very hot-tempered‚ ill-treating his wife‚ doing all kinds of things‚ and was never available at home for any difficulties…."" Moreover outside also he would go and aggress others‚ and trouble others. After Sahaj Yoga he changed‚ completely. Not good at jobs and then he gave up frustrated. Then he couldn't do well‚ anywhere‚ started a business‚ he got a loss and all that. And [hence] more frustration. Then he came to Sahaj Yoga. And he developed a personality‚ a security. He became very rich suddenly. He was surprised at himself and he is not attached. He said‚ ""All these riches I have got Mother‚ I want to do [use] it for Sahaja Yoga."" He bought a plot of land‚ big plot of land and he wants to start a Sahaj school there. I was amazed at him. He said‚ ""No‚ what is it‚ how much money do I need? It's more than sufficient!"" He started working it out that way. And then seeing him‚ this gentleman changed; the one who was the chartered accountant. And I saw his face: I was amazed. Not the same person. So much‚ just like a blossom. I said‚ ""What happened?"" ""It's nothing. I get up in the morning‚ do my meditation. Evening I do my meditation‚ that has changed me."" Such a small thing [and] life has changed. But if you have to go for an interview people will get up at four o'clock in the morning! Then they get up. But if you have to meditate they don't: then it's a punishment to them. Especially in England‚ it's very much worse. But now gradually they have understood the value of it: how it helps you‚ to do meditation in the morning‚ and in the night. It's only five minutes in the morning and ten minutes in the evening [needed]. Not much.

There's no discipline about it. We don't want to force anything on you. No way of forcing will help. Because that has never helped. Also disciplining children and all that: I have found out a new method by which we can really discipline them better‚ which I am going to implement now on them. Let's see how it works out.

So‚ we should know the principle of Sahaja Yoga. And one of the principles of Sahaja Yoga is that we have to meditate if we have to grow. Meditation means at that time we are in thoughtless awareness: that time‚ neither future nor past. So we open out ourselves to the Primal Force‚ to this All-pervading Power‚ to fill us up with inspiration‚ with beautiful ideas. Actually like the nourishment of the tree which is achieved by the sap of the tree. And to feel the love of God. To feel how we are instruments of that love and how the love can flow through us.

So‚ in the morning I have told them to meditate [for] about five minutes or for say ten minutes. But you shouldn't put the watch: ""Now five minutes!"" And a bell rings. ""Oh‚ finished!"" (Laughter) That's not the [way]. You should enjoy. I have told some people five minutes [but] they go on sitting for one hour in joy. It's an enjoyment. It's the inner enjoyment
of the inner beauty of your Self‚ the inner glory of your Self. Watching yourself within is beautiful.",https://www.amruta.org/p/5099,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

17190,,,Feeling vibrations and ways and methods to increase sensitivity in hands,"The problem is‚ to prepare yourself for that awakening by not preparing yourself!  Be unprepared! Be simple! Just be simple! Be childlike! Just that. Which is such a difficult thing – to be simple. No elaborations are needed‚ nothing is needed for that‚ no preparations as such‚ except – open your heart. Now how will you open? Like that? (Mother moves her hands from the chest outward as if opening a pair of  doors in Her chest) Pay attention to your heart‚ just pay attention to your heart. You'll be amazed‚ it will start melting. Just melt your heart. The thawing starts as soon as you pay attention to it. Tensions will drop out and you will feel cool breeze.

So those Sahaja Yogis who came to Sahaja Yoga and didn't feel vibrations‚ should know that the fear that they have…. Everybody thinks there's a show on‚ like a dog show‚ like other shows you see. And they come with that idea. There's no show on. It's a thing that you have to achieve yourself‚ which you achieve‚ that state‚ automatically. Now this is about the Sahaja Yogis who feel that they do not feel any vibrations. Maybe sometimes it happens also in some places also‚ where the Vishuddhi Chakra is very bad‚ you don't feel any cool breeze. So doesn't matter! As long as you feel peaceful‚ enjoy them! Why worry about the vibrations? I don't understand. What is the need? If it is not there‚ well and good. As long as you feel the peace of your Spirit. You just put your hands to another person.

I remember one gentleman in India always used to say‚ ""Mother‚ I don't feel anything‚ I don't feel anything. I've done that‚ done this."" I said‚ ""Thank God you don't feel  it."" He said‚ ""Why do you say that‚ Mother?"" I said‚ ""Enjoy your peace! Enjoy it!"" But then he wouldn't listen so I said‚ ""All right‚ go and feel the vibrations of particular gentleman!"" And he got blisters on all his five fingers! (laughing) And he came to Me and said‚ ""Mother‚ Oh God!""  (laughing) I said‚ ""You wanted to feel now have the blisters! What can I do?""

So those who do not feel‚ also are avoiding some problems for the time being! Take it easy! Is a very good word (phrase) 'Take it easy!' Which is‚ you know‚ this word‚ has come very recently. It was not there‚ never. It was 'Run! Run! Run!' before. Now everybody says 'Take it easy!'

 Specially if you have been to some other gurus and some other 'meditation' centres and all that‚ where you have been jumping morning till evening‚ you see‚ you don't want to believe that Sahaja Yoga you get‚ only by sitting quietly! Now there are ways and methods for improving your vibrations. As you know‚ in Sahaja Yoga‚ they are all described. For people who suffer from ego‚ I think best thing is to put your hands into the ice‚ right hand‚ may be. It may work out. Try it! But don't prepare! Just push your hands into ice sometimes. It may work out. And for people who suffer from superego‚ little bit burning your hand on the candle may help. Just try!

 Because the hands are not sensitive. So there is a heat or a cool too much. Either you are a frozen personality or you are a heated personality‚ you are not in the centre. So if you are a frozen personality‚ better melt it a little bit‚ try! I never said this before because half of you would have run away if I had said this! But don't burn it to have blisters I am saying! Just a little bit‚ try to see that‚ if you burn your finger the sensitivity will improve. But someone is thinking just now that‚ ""If you have both the problems‚ what do you do?"" (laughter)

 There are permutations and combinations because if you get out of your ego you have a big superego that comes up‚ and if you get after your superego the ego comes up. There then‚ the attention has to be brought here [Mother puts Her palm on Her Brahmarandhra]. And Sahaja Yogis know what it is‚ here to keep attention here. If you can keep your attention here‚ then you are above this‚ and if something drops out it drops out forever because you are standing here.

Say‚ if I have a shawl‚ and somehow I can jump on to that gallery (pointing upwards to gallery in the hall) and this shawl falls off‚ then I never have it‚ isn't it‚ because I'm [up] there‚  and the shawl is down here.

 So‚ the ascent must take place. If you do not ascend…How do you ascend is through your attention. Where is your attention? Ask yourself‚ ""Where is my attention?""  Either you are counting your money‚ counting your votes or some people even count lampposts I am told! If they have nothing to do‚ they can go on doing whatever they like! But count your blessings! Count your blessings and your ascent will start. Count your blessings‚ and that is how you ascend‚ ascend in the Realm of God.",https://www.amruta.org/p/6233,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17200,,,How can we sustain a deep meditation throughout the day?,"Yogi: Shri Mataji‚ how can we sustain a deep meditation throughout the day?

Shri Mataji: You see‚ you are in meditation in a way. You are halfway in meditation and halfway not. Now if you try to develop a state of witness‚ then you are in meditation – just a state of witness. Whatever you see‚ just watch it. Just watching is the best way‚ and then you'll be surprised that you will find that you are in another world‚ and these people are only in another world. You are seeing them from another world. Then you will have compassion for them‚ you will have pity for them‚ you may also not like them – it's all these feelings will come up to you‚ but you'll be a person who is separated from them.",https://www.amruta.org/p/4249,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17210,,,Savikalpa state,"Yogi: Sometimes you can feel that you in yourself‚ in your center you are all right‚ but you move in circumstances that cause a disharmony in some other part of you.

That is the savikalpa state. That is you move‚ you see‚ though you are in that state of nirvichara‚ still you move to savikalpa state where you again get vikalpa. But you are‚ you are after all a realized soul‚ you see. So they have made three clear-cut things‚ that you can have savikalpa samadhi‚ you can have nirvichara samadhi and you can have pure nirvikalpa samadhi. Now from even that state‚ you see‚ you can get to that‚ and that's what you have to cut out – is to‚ when you see such a situation where you get involved‚ then you say‚ ""This is not‚ this is not‚"" and come out of it. It's a practice‚ a little practice can tell you. Like driving‚ by practice you master it in the same way.

When I know something is wrong‚ I know it is wrong and I know that they are doing wrong‚ but I just keep quiet and then they know what it was wrong and what was right. It is better to make others learn by mistakes than to tell them. No one likes to be told. Then they learn themselves by mistakes‚ ""Yes‚ I've done this mistake‚ that mistakes. I've ruined my life. Now come along."" But if you tell them‚ they can be very reluctant or could be vindictive also.",https://www.amruta.org/p/4249,,Nirvichara Samadhi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17220,,,About Bindu and the higher chakras above ,"Yogi: Shri Mother‚ could You say something about the Bindu and the higher chakras above that?

You see‚ I don't think you should worry too much about these. There's three stages higher than Sahasrara. I would suggest just now let us concentrate on Sahasrara‚ is a better idea. But Bindu‚ Ardha-Bindu and Valaya are the three stages in which one has to pass through later on‚ and you would pass gradually when you develop yourself horizontally. That's what we have started now‚ so let us keep to this idea that we have to develop ourself horizontally. We should see how we affect the other person‚ how we influence the another person. For example some people‚ you see‚ they are very egoistical and all that‚ they may come in contact with you and say‚ ""Oh‚ very nice person‚ charming person‚ this‚ that."" But actually that person is just very physically may be attractive‚ or may be a little brilliant type of a person but doesn't have anything much in it. But if that person standing next to you changes the mood and temperament of another person‚ then you can say that this person has a spiritual personality. So let us see how you affect the nature. Flowers – you saw the miracle of the flowers that I performed for you the other day. In the same way let us see what is the effect of your character on the trees‚ on your friends‚ or in the food that you make – everything changes‚ it's very beautiful. So we have to see that‚ how it works out.

I have known people who have never known what is poetry is‚ suddenly they become poets. Some who were never musicians started singing so well. Like Christine‚ you know Christine‚ she never used to sing‚ she had a horrible voice. And suddenly she started singing like a cuckoo-bird! So not only you‚ but on others what effect is had? What others feel about you? You see‚ how you are kind‚ good and sweet to others‚ not superficially‚ but your behavior should change another person‚ transform another person. Your presence should bring auspiciousness.",https://www.amruta.org/p/4249,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17230,,,About Sahasrara and Bindu,"Yogi: The Sahasrara is represented by the lotus‚ and is the lotus at the moment losing its petals and the fruit developing?

You see‚ it is represented as lotus because our brain is like a lotus‚ actually. If you cut it horizontally you can see as if you have cut the petals‚ and if you cut it vertically you can see that around the limbic area it is just like petals of lotus. But when you are enlightened what happens‚ they swell up and they open out‚ and they all have beautiful colors. They look like tongues of flames‚ and it's very beautiful. Now the Sahasrara is open and the lotus is open‚ and inside you find the fruit already there kept‚ which is the Agnya Chakra which sits there. You can see it very clearly. Agnya is yellow‚ yellow-covered as we say‚ like a gold cap is the Agnya there‚ beautiful Agnya is inside.

Now the fruit of the lotus is later on we see‚ and I would say that is called as Bindu state‚ where you become a bindu – a dot‚ it's a little dot – and that dot has to then grow. So it's the second stage starts when you become the fruit of the lotus.",https://www.amruta.org/p/4249,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17240,,,About attention,"Yogi: Shri Mataji‚ could You just say something about how we purify our attention? How we look beyond the human form and the differences between each other?

Pure attention? You see‚ your attention gets spoilt that when you put attention – say I put attention onto this glass‚ then I start thinking about this glass that ""Oh‚ it's a beautiful glass so now‚ so it's a very beautifully done one. Now somehow or other I should manage to steal it!"" Then attention moves further‚ ""How can I manage to steal this? And what should I do‚ what is the best way of stealing it?"" and all those things. So the attention gives‚ you see‚ into problems and problems because I have got for this a greed‚ I develop a greed. How I've developed? Because you see‚ supposing I put My attention to it and then a thought starts from there coming to Me‚ a reaction as such‚ this gives you a reaction. Then you start seeing a beautiful Ganesha there‚ then you say‚ ""Oh‚ I have never seen one like this!"" Like that the thought starts‚ you see‚ coming from all this. And that thought comes into My mind and gives Me ideas that I should do something like that‚ to steal the glass. All right?

Now‚ the pure attention would be that I just watch this without thinking. Anywhere that your attention goes and you start sort of getting involved into it or getting attached to it‚ you should try to just watch it without thinking. Go into thoughtless awareness‚ then you enjoy it the most. Now say for example‚ these carpets are very nice. One thing would be‚ if they belonged to Me I would be worried how to insure them‚ all these people are sitting‚ that would be spoilt‚ this‚ that – all these thoughts will come into My head. Supposing these belonged to you‚ then I'll think how to manage to take them with Me somehow‚ and how to suggest in a very clever way something that I can manage to take them away!

Now that is quite human and one can do that way‚ but beyond that all cleverness and cunning‚ best is to appreciate. How? By just looking at it without any thought. Artist has created it‚ he has put all his joy into it. I'm just enjoying the joy‚ just looking at it. So when you start enjoying the joy your attention will become pure‚ very pure. Because the enjoyment of it is‚ makes you a very sort of a dedicated person about it‚ because you feel that what is in this world after all? It's to enjoy. And if I have to enjoy everything‚ then why should I worry about getting it to Myself or stealing it‚ or doing all these tricks? Better is to enjoy. So the reward of it is so great that attention starts purifying itself.",https://www.amruta.org/p/4249,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17250,,,Workshop and meditation with Shri Mataji,"Now all the children should put their hands like this‚ alright? And watch me.

Lift your tongues and put them back as much as possible. Turn it backward. Let it feel the bliss of the Divine on its tip. Now put your chin down‚ touching your [neck]- don't close your eyes – in complete surrender. Put the chin [down]‚ but don't close your eyes.

Pay attention to your Sahasrara. Loosen your hands fully on the sides‚ make them loose. Sit straight.

Do not touch the palate. Now breathe in. Do not push back the tongue. Keep the tongue where it is. Breathe in. Now raise your stomach‚ without taking out the breath‚ upward‚ pushing the air upward towards the lungs. Push your stomach in.

Attention on the Sahasrara.

You'll start seeing light through Sahasrara. Sort of the Sahasrara becomes like eyes. Now leave it. Leave it now.

Raise your head. Now put back your heads.

Put the fingers [in the ears]. Put the attention to your Sahasrara‚ that's all. Don't say anything‚ no mantras.

Take out your tongue‚ push it back. Take in your breath. Push the stomach. That's good.

Now watch me continuously without blinking‚ without any pressure on the eyes. Attention on the Sahasrara.

You can do it without blinking.

May God bless you.

This is it: physically‚ we have worked out our attention on our Vishuddhi and on our Agnya. The left Vishuddhi is still there.

Now put your head more on the Right side‚ loose‚ like this. With the attention on the Sahasrara‚ looking at me. Put it loose. Hand to be loose. Loosen it.

Now better.

You feel the Kundalini rising?

Let us put ourselves into bandhan after raising our Kundalini. Raise. Attention on your Sahasrara. Don't close your eyes‚ push back your head. One. Again.

17270,,,What is meditation - Mana & Prana," Now‚ what We can do is to‚ Philip‚ what should I tell you the practical side‚ the meditation. All right? Let's see what this meditation is‚ what We have to do on a meditation.

The first thing we have got is the Left side – you see – is the Mana-Shakti‚ is the power of your emotions. All right? Now‚ emotions are connected with your Right side‚ also – prana. Say for example if you are emotionally disturbed‚ just now we got disturbed‚ so our shiva‚ our breathing also increased and we felt the whole body was sort of‚ say reacting and the‚ we were feeling the reaction of the Prana‚ Right side also. That it was trying to express itself. Like we started the tears‚ is the water-element and all that came in and the whole emotion was so much pouring out and with that our Prana was also involved.

Say for example if you are frightened‚ if you are frightened – [aside: {INDIST.}‚ it's all right] – if you are frightened too much then what happens? [aside: this is all right] If you are frightened than also you get your breathing very fast – isn't it? So it is connected. [aside: Yes‚ come in‚ come in!] So it is connected. If you are frightened it is connected – with your Prana‚ in your breathing and your whole system is connected with your emotions‚ physical system. If you cry too much‚ or if you weep too much‚ or if you are a sad person – that shows on your face‚ your Vishuddhi-Chakra also shows‚ and not only Anahata but also Vishuddhi. Then also your Agnya goes out. So all the Chakras reflect the Left side in such a way that physical manifestation is also there. So it proofs that both are very much connected.

So to‚ if you have to‚ somehow or other‚ dissolve these two sides within us‚ the left and the Right side – because if you do not dissolve it you are left half way here – so you have to dissolve these two things. And to dissolve these‚ what should we do? What can we do – in meditation?

[aside:] Can you suggest?

Say we have got Prana and Mana. Now Prana represents the Right side and the Mana-Shakti is the Left side. All right? These two have to be dissolved – in the air‚ means dissolved. Now how do we do it? To dissolve these two things‚ they are connected with each other. After realization‚ not. So before meditation We give ourselves a balance‚ all right? Which side is more resided left at the time. Supposing you are emotionally – at that time – disturbed‚ then you put your right to the left. If you are that time disturbed on the Left side – ah‚ I mean disturbed in that sense that if a Left side is frozen‚ then you raise your Left side and give yourself a balance before meditation.

Now let us see‚ which side is less‚ first of all. Put your hands like that. Are you all right? Getting cool breeze? Getting it? [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: May this side not.] All right. Better? Are you getting in this side? Now – something moving? Cool breeze is coming now? Is there a cool breeze? Is it? There is cool breeze in your hand? Are you feeling it? All right.

So once you have given yourself a balance then the best thing is to pay attention to your emotions‚ to Manas-Shakti. Watch them. You can enlighten your emotions by thinking of your Mother. All right‚ just enlighten them. Just She will solve the problem. Whatever are the problems in the Mana‚ all right? So once you get connected with those emotions and you start looking at them in your meditation you will see these emotions are rising within you and if you try to put these emotions on your Mother‚ as put at the Lotus-Feet of your Mother‚ they will start also dissolving those emotions and they'll become sort of – ah – expanded. Expanded‚ you see.

You will extend that in such a way that‚ you will feel you are in control‚ these emotions. You are in control of them and by that controlling those emotions your emotions – which are expanded‚ enlightened – are powerful. And these emotions‚ when you feel that way‚ then the cause of those emotions can be solved. For example just now you got emotionally stirred up because I talked about – say – these children. Naturally‚ anybody would be. Now when you are stirred up with that you put that problem and those feelings that are rising in you‚ that those waves of feelings that are coming at the Lotus-Feet of your Mother.

So they get touched‚ say by that power you can say. Then these emotions become enlightened and when these emotions become enlightened they have a power to solve the problem. Do you see the point? As if they had reached the shore where they got the light and this problem can be solved. Because now you are not in an individual self‚ you are in the expanse‚ you are in the samashti and because you have entered into that position‚ that's why you have got these powers of entering to another person's body‚ to see the vibrations of another person‚ to raise the Kundalini. Otherwise you could not have done it.

So for you it is very easy to [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: weep] because I am also sitting here in Person. So easy to put these emotions just there so that they get enlightened and your wish is fulfilled‚ because emotions are nothing but wishes. These are unfulfilled wishes. Now how they do it otherwise is also this way that you take up these emotions and put them‚ so that is‚ these emotions are actually – the Left side‚ as I said‚ is the desire.

So the desire is taken‚ any desire‚ and is put in the Prana. Now how do you put it on the Prana? That you control your Prana – that's why they do Prana-yamas‚ you see? Like you sit down now‚ very comfortably‚ now you have a desire‚ you put your attention to that. Attention is very important – you see? Now this attention is to be put onto the Prana‚ so the emotions are there and then bring those emotions and put them into your attention‚ means they are now‚ you are aware of them.

Now what you do is to watch your breathing. See now‚ try to reduce your breathing‚ reduce it. In the sense that you have breathed out‚ wait for a while‚ then breath in – for a long time. Then you breathe out. So in one minute your breezing will be less than normal. All right? Try that. Breathe in – now with the emotions‚ keep the attention on the emotions – you see? – so that the connection is established.

Hmm. Better? You see the Kundalini rises? Now when you are breathing you find that there is a space in-between‚ which you just leave it vacant. Breathe in! Now leave it vacant. Now breathe out. Now leave it vacant. Breathe in. Keep it there. Then leave it. Keep out-side. Now breathe in. Now start breathing in such a way that you stop your breathing. Your attention should be on the heart‚ or could be on the emotions.

It's better? Keep the breathing inside for a while‚ then bring it out‚ then outside for a while. Then again‚ then you'll find that for a while you will not breathe. Hmm. You see‚ you settle down. The layer takes place between your Prana and your Mana. Both the Shaktis become one. Now at this stage when you are silent‚ now you think of your intellect – it's lost. Now just think of it‚ it's lost‚ it's no more there. So what is happening‚ actually that this layer – the attention goes into the intellect and enlightens the intellect.

Aha‚ now see‚ the thought is not there – try to find your intellect within yourself! Now see! See‚ where is my intellect? Try to find it! It's not there‚ it's not working. Again try it! It is working‚ but it has become the samashti‚ has become the collective now. Ha! See now! Did you follow that? There is no thought. This exercise will give you this thoughtless awareness‚ establishes in you the thoughtless awareness. There is no thought. So the second lesson – all right?

May God bless you!  ...""",https://www.amruta.org/p/5058,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

17300,,,Workshop on Left Vishuddhi," Shri Mataji: This centre what we call as ""left Vishuddhi"". Now have you told them about left Vishuddhi?
Sahaja Yogi: No‚ not the specific sides‚ just the general things of it.
Shri Mataji: All right.
Now‚ this left Vishuddhi comes to you if you have said mantras wrongly. You see‚ the mantras are to be said only when there is a realised soul who knows what mantras are to be said. And if you do not know about it‚ you accept the mantras. Anybody who tells you‚ ""Say this mantra""‚ you just start saying it‚ without understanding‚ whether it is given by an authority or not. Also you don't know whether it is meant for you or not. Maybe it is not required for some. Any particular mantra may not be required. And some of the mantras are absolutely absurd things. So mantras also‚ it's a very big science. And just now I am feeling the left Vishuddhi. Also one feels it‚ even if you have not taken mantras‚ if you have been feeling guilty. Like‚ you see‚ if you are used to confessions and things like that‚ if you are used to a situation where you feel that ""I'm guilty for this"". You know‚ the norms of today's modern life are so funny‚ that even for small thing you have to feel guilty. For example if you put the fork in a wrong way‚ you feel guilty: ""Oh God‚ I should not have done this."" Like that‚ the life is so complicated‚ but very‚ very small things can also make you feel guilty. So if you are feeling guilty also you feel this centre very much.

Now‚ this centre is very important‚ because if this centre is not all right‚ then Kundalini doesn't rise. She pulls this‚ at this point. Half of it is pulled out. And there is a blockage. And so Kundalini does not rise. Now‚ one should not feel guilty about anything‚ whatsoever! There is nothing to feel guilty or to going for confessions and all the time saying‚ ""I am such a sinner"" and I should not have done this and I should not have done that. Because‚ as I told you yesterday‚ God is the ocean of love‚ He is the ocean of compassion and He is the ocean of forgiveness. So we should not unnecessarily condemn ourselves. Moreover you are the temple of God. And if you condemn yourself like that‚ that ""I'm good for nothing‚ I am useless""‚ then you are condemning that temple which is created by God. You have not created yourself. So you have no right to condemn yourself. Now little mistakes if you have done doesn't matter. Because I am talking of the ocean. So little mistakes here and there can always be corrected. So one should not feel guilty.
Now see‚ are you feeling the vibrations in hands? Let's see  ...""",https://www.amruta.org/p/7149,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17310,,,Workshop on Left Vishuddhi," Shri Mataji: That means you have to be cheerful people. When you are entering into the kingdom of God you have to be cheerful people. Now‚ so many people who have a heart trouble are very much affected by this blockage. If there is‚ this blockage is there‚ it's difficult to cure the heart of a person. So first of all we should say that‚ ""We are not guilty at all."" Believe Me‚ you are not guilty. If you believe Me‚ it will work out.
It's better now? (towards the Yogi sitting in front)
Sahaja Yogi: The same.
Shri Mataji: Same? Not feeling anything. ? Put it up. It will help you. Better now. Are you feeling guilty?

Sahaja Yogi: She tries not to. [Laughter]
Shri Mataji: But why? Just say‚ ""I'm not guilty."" Can you say that: ""Mother‚ I am not guilty."" Say it within yourself. Just say it honestly‚ say you are not guilty‚ that's all.

Better now‚ working out.
Just say one little thing‚ ""Mother I am not guilty"". This is a mantra to overcome this center. [Shri Mataji laughs] It is a simple mantra to say that.
Sahaja Yogi: ""Mother I am not guilty"" it's the mantra for the left Vishuddhi.

17320,,,Workshop on Left Heart," Now this one‚ this finger (little finger) is a little bit touching. Now this is a very important finger because this represents the heart‚ the organ‚ the heart. That means that you have to accept that you are the Spirit‚ because the Spirit resides in your heart. So you have to accept that you are the heart and Spirit cannot commit any mistakes also.

If not‚ you could have been to some guru and that's why there is an opposition. So now‚ what you do‚ is to put your right hand on your liver. I'm sorry‚ left hand on your liver. Left hand on your liver.
Hum‚ ok. Is it still hot? Better now?
Better.

All the skin troubles come from liver. Allergies come from lethargic liver. And those who have other troubles of the liver‚ like sometimes you feel like vomiting‚ nauseating‚ your attention is not all right‚ all that comes from bad liver.
So for that we have to understand that‚ carbohydrates are required to compensate for the over-activity that you are doing. Now‚ if you get tonight some sugar and salt‚ all of you‚ I will vibrate it for you and you can use it. That will solve your problem of the liver.
It's better now‚ just put it like that straight. Are you feeling better?

Sahaja Yogi: it's liver.
Shri Mataji: It means liver. This is a liver patient‚ definitely a liver patient‚ this one. Now‚ for such a hand‚ what should you do‚ is to take the water that I've given you and boil it with radish leaves. And take radish leaves and sugar with it. That water you have to take for some time. Specially when you have this flood water. After that you should be careful‚ because people can get jaundice. You see‚ this flood is not such a disaster. The after effects of floods are. This water is not good‚ you should not take any other water but spring water. Spring water you should drink and as far as possible be careful about jaundice. If jaundice sets in‚ the only solution is that you should take radish leaves‚ eat lot of radish and boil it in that water that I give you today and put some sugar in it and just take that water‚ nothing else.
Because that's one thing one has to be careful when such a flood comes in the after effects of the floods can be felt. All right? So we have to save the Realised souls. They are very precious to God.

Now this is also – thank God‚ despite all changes in the Bible – it's written in the Bible that you'll be known by the mark you'll be carrying. Now let's see how many are courageous‚ even in India‚ to carry this mark? That's why you people catch so fast. One of the reasons why you people catch‚ first of all‚ the eyes are not steady. You are not used to the steady eyes‚ you see‚ as the Indians have very steady eyes. They are‚ from childhood they are taught: ""Where is your attention?"" All the time they are asked: ""Where is your attention?""

[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi: There are some Western Sahaja Yogis standing at the back. Please give them a chair to sit‚ since they are not able to sit on the ground.]

So where is your attention?
Now the attention is so disturbed all the time and that's why you catch very fast‚ and when you catch from your eyes‚ it goes through your Agnya Chakra. Now this [bindi] is the protection of Agnya Chakra; it's actually the blood of Christ that you wear. But people must have that courage. They'll wear a cross‚ but not this.
In the Western countries‚ it's very difficult for people to have that much courage to put on this. They will have excuses: ""Mother‚ we'll lose our jobs‚"" this‚ that. Every sort of an excuse is there. But if you are courageous people‚ then you have to start wearing it some time. Maybe in the night you start first‚ then in the daytime. [Laughter]
Slowly‚ slowly you can creep into it. That's the only thing I think you people have to wear‚ that's important. That will be a good idea‚ because you will not catch. Because you go outside‚ your attention is outside‚ you see what's happening outside‚ the atmosphere is bad.

17450,,,Give up your problems," I mean‚ best things to get rid of problems is not to have them. In the sense: now I don""t drive so I have no problem of driving. I don""t have - I never telephone‚ so I don""t have problems of telephones. I don""t go to the banks‚ so I don""t have problems of the banks. The best is: I don""t have any income so I have no problem of income tax. Whatever bothers you‚ you just don""t have it. Why do you want to have it? Have it and then bother about it? It seems very funny that you can get rid of anything that bothers you very easily in this world‚ so you need not have that kind of a thing on your head. But when the word ˜problem""‚ specially in the European community ˜problem"" is a very common word‚ but in English language we never learnt this word ˜problem"". You see only the ˜problem"" was used when we were studying geometry‚ geometrical problem‚ but we never knew there""s a problem in life. Later on when I came in contact with European community‚ they""ll say‚ There""s no problem. This is the problem. At least in one day hundred times they say ˜problem"" word. So‚ for a problem the solution is not to have that thing which gives you problem. You can give up anything. Anything that you want‚ you can give up if you know how to detach yourself from that.

Many people come and tell Me‚ Mother we have an ego. That""s the problem.

I said‚ Then give up.

I mean‚ is simple‚ why do you have it? As if‚ you see‚ they want to say that‚ We have trouble with this thing but still we are clinging on to it. Like we are afraid of a crocodile but we want to put our foot into the mouth of the crocodile. And we have a problem that our foot will be eaten up by the crocodile. Now give up. But they will search out a crocodile‚ open the mouth‚ and put the foot in it and then come to Me and say‚ Mother we have a problem. My foot is in the mouth of the crocodile.

To get to problems you have to get to it. But without getting to it‚ how will you get a problem? Say‚ for example‚ people have very silly‚ stupid problems. Now‚ the first problem somebody may have‚ Oh I have to get my clothes pressed. What""s the need? No problem. Wear them as they are. Who looks at it? You see there are all the people who have pressed clothes. Doesn""t matter what is there. If it is not pressed‚ it""s a problem for them.

17460,,,Where the chakras are in the body," Yogi: There seems to be some difference of opinion on parts of the body that are represented here‚ and here‚ and there. Could You tell us please‚ Shri Mataji?]

I see. These chakras are represented outside also in our body‚ we can say‚ that on our feet as you know: you know the Nabhi‚ Nabhi is the thumb* (you be seated and I'll tell you; you'll know) – Nabhi is the thumb‚ and left and right Nabhi. Then second finger from the thumb is the Vishuddhi‚ the third finger is the Swadishthana‚ the fourth finger is the Agnya‚ and the fifth finger is the Heart. Now this is the – our basis.

Then in the hands they change‚ as you know. In the hands you know very well‚ I need not tell about the hands. Now in your hand‚ we can say‚ this one [LEFT SHOULDER] here is the Lalita Chakra‚ also is the part of the Vishuddhi Chakra. It works out the Vishuddhi Chakra‚ Lalita Chakra. And then this is the Nabhi [ELBOW] and this is the Vishuddhi [WRIST]. Swadishthana is in between‚ you can say. Now‚ Heart is here [LITTLE FINGER] so any time you have this finger paining too much‚ then you must know there's some trouble with the Heart. But Heart is not in all these things‚ but sometimes‚ sometimes it could be felt here [LEFT UPPER ARM]. Heart Chakra can be felt here with a reflection maybe‚ on this side.

So we can do like this‚ is to say: Vishuddhi‚ Heart‚ then Nabhi‚ then Swadishthana‚ and then … sorry! This is the Vishuddhi [SHOULDER]‚ this is Swadishthana [UPPER PART OF UPPER ARM]‚ this is Heart [LOWER PART OF UPPER ARM]‚ and this is Nabhi [ELBOW]‚ and this one is – but I never use them‚ so I just don't know! – Heart [LOWER ARM]‚ and this is Vishuddhi [WRIST]. All right?

But you can feel it sometimes even Heart here [UPPER ARM]‚ because if Swadishthana is very active your Heart goes out‚ so you can feel it here. It's a very important thing that we should have that discrimination‚ because if I tell you something maybe you are not yet that level of discretion‚ and you may get confused. So this is the Vishuddhi [WRIST]. Now there is pain here‚ that means there is problem with your Vishuddhi. Now sometimes you have a problem‚ say‚ on your Vishuddhi – now you can pull this finger. Just to pull the finger nicely‚ and you'll be surprised‚ the vibrations coming out of left Vishuddhi. Any one‚ you have any problem‚ you can pull them. And that is how all the chakras are placed in the body.

In the same way downward if you move‚ this is the Nabhi [KNEE]‚ this is the Swadishthana‚ both are Swadishthana (hip and upper leg)‚ and this is the Heart [LOWER LEG]‚ and this is the Vishuddhi at the ankle bone. This is Vishuddhi at the ankle bone. So the main thing to remember are the Vishuddhis‚ because Vishuddhi‚ Nabhi and Swadishthan: these three are important‚ because they go off immediately as soon as – supposing there is a Nabhi patient sitting with you‚ you'll immediately have a problem on your Nabhi (knee). But these [UPPER AND LOWER LEG] sometimes manifest‚ not all the time‚ so they can be confusing. But Swadishthana specially. Like‚ when I got down in Canberra I just couldn't walk‚ both the Swadishthanas went like that‚ you see. I didn't know how to move. It was terrible because both the Swadishthanas were caught up – for a while‚ but they were.

Seeker: I always when I feel warm‚ it becomes better. In the morning‚ if I put it under hot water-
Shri Mataji: It's better. And that's what you have to do‚ is to use the candle. Use the candle and they will tell you how to do it‚ how to use the candle. You see‚ you have to use the candle and it will be all right. Because whatever it is‚ you see‚ it's a Left side virus you have got‚ virus‚ infection. And for the virus you have to use the light. Light. Light is more than the heat. It's not the heat‚ it's the light that will help you a lot. They'll tell you how to use it‚ it will go away.
Improving now very much. That's why it helps you. In the medical science they never use light as such‚ you see. For all these troubles‚ left-sided problems‚ we even cured cancer with candle‚ and – but takes time‚ but we cured cancer‚ plus all these psychosomatic diseases. We have to use only candles. The light has to be used.
His left Nabhi is too much.
Wolfgang: He is married again now‚ Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: You see‚ now the candle also reacts. It reacts. You see how the candles is reacting. Better‚ yes.
Better than before‚ much better‚ much better. Much better now.
You see the thing is‚ that you have to work it out with the candle‚ they'll tell you‚ it's very simple. But you have to give little time to yourself‚ that's all. Usual it's the left-side‚ as we call it‚ is the virus‚ a kind of a virus in you‚ that has to go again away. Once the virus is cured‚ you are all right. But see‚ you are much better now. You see now. You see his hand has opened out.
Seeker: It's very good.
Shri Mataji: Yes‚ it's very good‚ there is no pain also. But what you have to do now‚ is to really work it out. It will hardly take two‚ three times and you can be cleared of it. Just two‚ three times. Two‚ three times will be all right. It's just a virus infection of what you call the allergic. Allergic conditions are nothing but viruses‚ allergic. And these viruses are the plants and things‚ that have gone out of the circulation of evolution. So‚ they live on the left-side‚ in the collective subconscious‚ you see‚ the area which was built in. And they attack you. Once they attack you‚ then medical cannot cure it‚ you see. It's a psychosomatic trouble. And now in his case also same thing. Only the candle can cure it. With candle‚ they will tell you how to use. You have to use my photograph. All right? You'll be all right. It's nothing special‚ great. This hand‚ is it better? See‚ the other hand also. You see‚ other hand.
Seeker: Here‚ I have only this one. [Right Agnya]
Shri Mataji: This one is yes‚ Agnya‚ this one is. That is better. So‚ your left-side is problematic. Now better.
But don't sell these artificial things‚ because‚ you see‚ allergy could be from nylons‚ from anything‚ I mean people get with nylon – they get rushes [unsure]‚ you know‚ so many allergies are there due to these artificial things. You ask any doctor‚ they'll tell you‚ so many types of allergies are there. Endless‚ absolutely endless.

17480,,,About Hamsa Chakra‚ advice," Yogi: Shri Mataji‚ could You please tell us more about Hamsa Chakra?

Hamsa Chakra? Hamsa Chakra is placed here (at top of nose) where some of the nerves which are coming from Ida and Pingala cross over‚ and is a part of Vishuddhi Chakra. Plus the connection with Vishuddhi and Agnya: as you must have read in the Devi Mahatmyam that Shri Krishna is the Father of Christ‚ so the connection between the two is maintained here. And this is very important‚ Hamsa Chakra is‚ that if your Hamsa Chakra is not all right‚ your discretion is very poor.

This chakra will get easily dried out. Like if you eat very dried food‚ you see. Say‚ sometimes you also offer Me some dried food‚ and I have to tell you that not to give too dry food. You must eat it with some sauce or some liquid thing‚ because if you eat very dry food also this becomes very dry. And it's very important because if this portion becomes dry‚ you can put some oil or ghee into it to make it all right. But from here starts the drying of the peritoneum and the lining. If the peritoneum gets dried up‚ the whole body gets dried up. It can be anywhere; in the lung if it is dried up it can cause you lung cancer. As even the peritoneum can be in a cancer state. So one has to be very careful not to take something very dry‚ all the time dry food and dry things. Moreover‚ not to put anything to make this a lubricant – some sort of a lubricant should be there so there's no problem on this chakra. Because first of all it loses your discretion‚ you don't understand things‚ you don't know what to do. You mean it‚ you mean good‚ but you don't do. When you achieve something‚ it's something not so good. The reason is‚ your discretion is poor. For that this must not be made dry.

I have told many a times to put some ghee every day. Get a little bottle of ghee‚ keep it with you with a little dropper. You can put it in the hot water‚ you can heat it up every day‚ and take two drops in the nose in the night and in the morning time. It doesn't take much‚ but it should be done. It's for your good  ...""",https://www.amruta.org/p/4249,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17490,,,Advices‚ Hamsa Chakra‚ Ghee‚ Oil," This one is the Hamsa‚ is very important Hamsa is. We use when we want to show our temper‚ indifference. Then a person thinks ""Oh God‚ what have I done to this person?"" That's how we show our temper‚ all the time like this. That's Hamsa and that's why we have to use what we call the simple thing called ghee or something oilish for ears‚ for nose‚ for eyes the kajal and for this portion also. We have to put some ghee in hot water or milk and take it so that you sooth down your nerves and you smooth down your Vishuddhi and also you sooth down the what you call in a general way is the peritoneum but is the lining. Lining as we sooth down our fingers and hands when they are dried‚ we have to sooth them. Rub ghee here‚ ghee here‚ oil here‚ oil there‚ in the head. Now‚ the modern style is not to put oil in the head‚ you'll become balds. Balded gentleman‚ of course you can still act like Yull Brinner‚ but he died of cancer. His sister is our disciple‚ and you will develop funny hair styles everything and of this modern fashion has started don't put any oil‚ I don't know from it has come. The children also they say ""don't put any oil in the ears""‚ this is doctors‚ they want to create patients‚ don't listen to them. Before going traveling or anywhere‚ put oil in your ears‚ into your noses not the oil but ghee‚ and control your peritoneum through your Hamsa chakra‚ is very important. This is the chakra which really helps you very much to soothe down. Now in Sanskrit and also in many colloquial languages‚ ghee is called as ""mir""‚ and sneha is love. Neha also is love. So you have to oil it down‚ so the frictions are less. We know in nature‚ when we have reduce the friction‚ we put oil.

Like we have to say launch a ship‚ I've launched I know what it is‚ they had to put grease on the thing‚ and it just touched the ship and the ship moves‚ so smoothly onto the sea. Beautifully it moves. In India they put bananas‚ because bananas is a very easily available‚ so they put bananas you see under. Here they use grease‚ in England for example they use grease. So in the same way‚ we have to grease ourselves. Our language‚ our tone‚ our speaking must be greased‚ greased with love and love is such a powerful thing that can attract any one let it be even Hitler. When you talk to someone or say something‚ it should have that coating of chocolate of Love‚ then you can give even give castor oil‚ I do that. So‚ all these things are to be understood in its essence [Vedas] says that we should not become stupid as the other people are.

17500,,,Agnya advises‚ eyes on the Mother Earth," Now‚ Christ who is Shri Ganesha and who has all the powers to kill us and finish us off and destroy us completely has given us the greatest weapon‚ is to forgive. So the mantra here is ""forgive"" and you have to see that you forgive others. Any body says anything‚ forgive. When you forgive‚ God takes over. And He knows how to handle or mishandle‚ to do whatever He likes to that person. That's not your job‚ you just forgive‚ so you give him a ticket‚ go to God‚ I forgive you‚ and you‚ you have to forgive you have nothing to do‚that is the thing you can enjoy your Agnya chakra very well‚ and raise your Kundalini beyond by saying ""forgive‚ forgive‚ forgive""‚ three times‚ and you have to say the mantra of Nirvichara‚ no thoughts. Agnya is the one which brings thoughts to you‚ that's why Christ was so particular on the eyes‚ that ""thou shall not have adulterous eyes""‚ try to concentrate your eyes on the mother Earth for some time‚ she'll suck in‚ so that your attention doesn't become that wobbly‚ becomes concentrated‚ and equalized and balanced. When that is done your eyes become so powerful even if you look at somebody‚ you can cure that person and the innocence will start coming in your eyes‚ you will not have lust and greed.

It is a very dangerous thing people are playing here‚ I mean‚ I didn't know all these things people do but I saw it in the West‚ I mean‚ everybody is looking at every girl‚ what is the joyless pursuit? Why‚ turn your eyes to anything that you don't enjoy at all‚ you don't get joy out of it. At every girl a man is looking‚ a girl is looking at every man‚ what's this nonsense? Why waste your energy. I always look at about 3 feet height‚ you see all the flowers there‚ you see all the children. One day somebody asked Me‚ ""don't you feel like looking at handsome men""? I said ""I'm not a fool‚ I look at the most handsome things‚ at 3 feet level"". He said‚ you must be a fool to look at this. I'm not‚ that is what it is. So that will give you tremendous amount of energy‚ because you preserve all your energy through your eyes. Eyes are the windows of that Power. If you try to preserve it‚ it's alright‚ otherwise like now they say ""save water‚ because you've wasted your water‚ so now save water"".

But when your eyes are innocent in this shower of bliss‚ you enjoy that bliss‚ you don't have to look at anyone‚ you don't have to say anything‚ you just enjoy‚ just feel the joy pouring into you completely.

17520,,,Advice for meditation," For meditating‚ you should say that‚ ""Mother‚ make me the Spirit. I am the Spirit. Mother‚ I am the Spirit.""  You start seeing through the eyes of the Spirit everything‚ then you do not feel bad. You laugh at yourself‚ make fun of yourself‚ and then you enjoy yourself‚ only with yourself. You play with yourself. You joke with yourself. And the whole thing becomes a joke.

But for this‚ when you meditate‚ you find out first of all what is the matter with you. But not mentally you resolve it‚ through your vibrations and mantras. Mantras are very important for Sahaja Yogis. If these mantras could be said‚ loudly is better in the beginning. That is why‚ in privacy‚ you can do all these things‚ in your room you can work it out. Now you can use lemons‚ you can use water‚ you can use light‚ you can use ether‚ aakash‚ you can use sea – all these things you can use to cleanse yourself.

Once you start facing yourself through your Spirit‚ you won't be so frightened. Because you do not want to face yourself‚ you are all the time in that mood of frightened‚ fear. But once you start facing [yourself]‚ you will be amazed that‚ really‚ you are beautiful‚ and all these things will drop out. So there is no need to condemn yourself in any way‚ or to elate yourself‚ but just be your Spirit.

The best way to be with your Spirit is to forgive‚ forgive‚ because then your thoughts will go away. I mean‚ here there are people with superego‚ but as soon as you remove their superego‚ they get into ego very fast‚ I've seen it. I mean‚ they are really basically egos‚ actually‚ as if‚ from the horse they have fallen for a while and as soon as you take them away‚ then lift them‚ they just jump onto the horse again‚ it's like that. So one has to be very careful about this point. Now when you meditate‚ how much time‚ again‚ you are thinking? All this meticulousness‚ if you try‚ then again you are thinking. You just take the proper place to sit down‚ keep the photograph before you and just feel your vibrations – where are you catching?

Alright. Then you know how to remove your catches. Without thinking‚ try to do that. Then say the mantras on different chakras‚ wherever you are catching‚ first of all. First of all ascertain them (which are catching)‚ need not say all the mantras. Only say the mantras in that part‚ with your heart.

17540,,,How to steady the Agnya," But I don't say‚ ""You fight your ego‚"" because it is not that important to fight. You are fighting with your shadow. You have shadow‚ which is called as ego: Which is not to be fought and to waste your energy on him. There's no need to fight him. Only thing [is]‚ if you stand in the centre of the light – you don't see any shadow. It is so simple as that. If you stand in the centre of light that is Christ‚ you don't see any shadow anywhere. But when I say this‚ I may sound like other people who give sermons‚ ""Stand in the shadow of Christ"" or ""Stand in the light of Christ."" Now what does that mean? Where is that light‚ where is that place where you should stand? And that place is here in the centre of your optic thalamus where there is no thought. You have to stand in thoughtless awareness.

Many people who have had a problem with Agnya‚ many people who have come… (interruption in talk) …thoughts will stop and they will be beyond thought. And this a very‚ very important chakra for sahaja yogis because when the Kundalini rises above‚ above the Agnya chakra – immediately there is no thought. You do not get any thoughts from ego or superego. But there is a wobbling in the Agnya because of your imbalanced ways. And the imbalanced ways are‚ that sometimes you are with ego or with superego.

This has happened to our people in the West because we have had so much of ego [that] we got really tired of it. We got frightened with it. Then we started taking to drugs and things to increase our superego. But by doing that‚ what we are doing is pushing by one end bringing by another end and that's how we are wobbling our ego and superego‚ by which we are not helping ourselves at all.

So what one has to do is to rise within oneself up to the point of Agnya and try to steady your Agnya.

There are many people have asked Me one question: ""How to steady the Agnya?"" Agnya is placed at the crossing point of our nerves and also optic thalamus. Now‚ so it is said that‚ if you have wobbling eyes‚ you'll have a wobbling Agnya. You have to steady your eyes‚ you have to soothe them. Now it is very‚ very out of date‚ ancient‚ old and all sorts of names that you call it‚ to a thing like that‚ but you must steady your eyes and steady them in such a way that it is very soothing for the eyes. [That] which is the most soothing thing for the eyes is the green grass. If you could see the green grass with your eyes‚ means you walk with your eyes on the ground‚ your eyes will be soothed‚ your Agnya will be alright  ...""

17570,,,If you take bath with cold water you can never catch cold," If you take bath with cold water you can never catch cold because the temperature is the same. For a while you will feel it's cold water‚ but it's very good – those people who take bath with cold water. Did you get hot water to have baths? Where?

Sahaja Yogi: In Rahuri. Even in Brahmapuri.

Shri Mataji: You had hot water? That's very wrong. That's the reason [you got sick]. That explains it. If you have to take bath with hot water then you must get into your bed. If you have to take it in the open‚ sure shot you will get temperature. Absolutely sure shot.

This is a very simple thing which I don't know how you don't know. You should never take your bath in the open with the hot water. That's sure shot. I mean‚ in the school supposing some boy doesn't want to go‚ then what he does‚ he keeps the window open and takes his bath with hot water – finished! – he gets a temperature immediately the next day.

So in Brahmapuri if they have given you hot water‚ you should not have taken bath. That was wrong. Even if you had got it. I mean‚ river Ganges‚ I don't know how many have been to River Ganges? You have been. Now the water is freezing cold I tell you‚ it's absolutely freezing cold. When you put your foot you will just push it back‚ it's so cold. But people get into it. Slowly‚ slowly‚ they just move; slip into it. And when you come out your cheeks are red like apples! It's so very cold. Isn't it? But nothing happens. Nobody catches cold or anything.

So in the running water is the cleanest and where you could get in‚ get into cold water. Otherwise‚ even if you have to take a hot water bath‚ take it in the night or maybe at the time when you can go off into your bed. In England also people take their baths in the night mostly and get into bed. Supposing you take hot bath in England and go out – immediately you will get cancer of the lungs.

Hot and cold is a very important thing one has to know. Like also you can see on the hands you feel hot and cold. So now supposing you have taken the coffee‚ after that you cannot take anything cold. Is a simple thing one should understand. First you can take anything cold. Like I have seen people take coffee and then ice cream! I mean‚ [it's] sure you get troubles! Absolutely sure. But if you are taking ice cream‚ first take ice cream‚ then take a biscuit and then take some water‚ then take some biscuit and then you can take something hot. Now supposing you have taken something hot and you have to take water also. Then take three biscuits.

Another very great precaution you have to take which I have seen nobody takes. Now it sometimes becomes very hot outside. You are sitting down into programs or something‚ becomes very hot. You are sitting in the sun sometimes and your head gets very heated up. Immediately [if] you go and get cold water‚ definitely you will get sick‚ no doubt about it. That's the best way to get sick!

So‚ if you are sitting in the sun‚ immediately you should never‚ never‚ never take any water till you have eaten something sweet. Take some sugar‚ or take some jaggery‚ or some biscuit or something. Even if you are very thirsty you should not do it.

Little precautions have to be taken. Nothing should happen to Sahaja Yogis. Because if you get sick‚ I get sick. That's the problem is. And that's why I was so sick yesterday. I knew that you must be all very sick – that's why it has happened to me  ...""",https://www.amruta.org/p/5008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

17590,,,How to meditate on different chakras ," Shri Mataji: It's a very good question. You see‚ when you meditate; how do you meditate on different chakras?

Say you have to meditate on Mooladhara‚ now you pay attention towards Mooladhara and take the name of Shri Ganesha. Say the mantra. You know there are four petals; so every – that mantra should be every time should be four times should be said. Four into four you can say. Pay attention there.

Now physically also say we have a Nabhi Chakra‚ so many of you catch at Nabhi. If you have a liver problem‚ you can rub a little sugar on your Nabhi‚ will be a good idea. Or if you have the left hand side problem of Nabhi‚ if you rub a little oil or ghee or something it will be a good idea. And then concentrate on that. Try to put attention onto that‚ specially the chakras which are not all right. You just pay attention to it and meditate on them. Pay attention to it is the main point. If you pay attention with the mantras saying‚ that's how you can meditate on every chakra.

And if two people can do it‚ is a better idea. Is‚ you see‚ in your back‚ on your back; if you show the spinal chord‚ you can see what chakras are bulging out. Other person can tell you these are the portions which are bulging out. So you go on saying the mantras of that chakra paying attention and the other person can tell you whether it is all right or not. For every chakra there is a mantra‚ which you know. Apart from mantra‚ you must know what things should be used‚ which element should be used for which chakra. 

For example‚ for using Mooladhara chakra: the best way to clear out Mooladhara chakra is sit on the ground; it's the best way. I have told you how to do the exercise to be able to sit on the ground straight. It's a very good idea of asking the Mother Earth to clear out your Mooladhara.

For example‚ if you have to clear out your Nabhi: Nabhi is made out of the water element and that's why you have to ask the water element to help you. And for Nabhi water element is the best. If you can use the water element to clear your Nabhi it will be a very good idea.

Like that‚ every chakra is made from some element as it is. 

Swadishthana is made of earth and water; so the sea is the best for Swadishthana. If you could go to the sea and work out on Swadishthana it will be the best for you; any ocean. Or you can use salt and water for Swadishthana‚ will be very good.

Then we can say that for the heart chakra: heart chakra is‚ has to do with the‚ what you call‚ the akash‚ firmament. With the firmament‚ this heart chakra is with the…no not firmament. Akash? Akash nahi (Hindi: Not ether). It's made out of air. Air is called…Hindi me kya hai? Vayu! Vayu! Vayu! Vayu! Is air. Air or you call it air‚ as an element you call the word air? Or firmament? Firmament is ether in English‚ isn't it? So air‚ you can say air. Air element is for the heart chakra.

So for that I have told you how to do breathing. Breathing is the best way: to hold your breath before the photograph. Or you can take the breath in‚ deep breathing‚ and releasing it for a longer period; cleaning it. All these exercises are there. Then you see the mantra is of raksha‚ is the protection‚ to ask for the protection‚ is all with the air. All right?

Then we come to this one is here is the‚ English me shabd kya ho gaya? (Hindi: 'what is the English word?')  Tej‚ Vayu‚ Akash…Akash ko kya shabd hai‚ angrezi me? (Hindi: What is the word for akash in English?) Must be firmament. What is a 'firmament' in English?

Yogi: Ether.

Shri Mataji: Ether? Firmament is ether? All right‚ so this is the firmament then.  I have read one translation but I was not sure. This (Vishuddhi) is the akash‚ is the sky. This is the sky‚ here. All right? This is made out of the sky‚ firmament. And this (Agnya) is made out of the light.

Firmament is sky‚ is it? 

Yogi: Yeah.

Shri Mataji: So this is sky. That's why it is Virata this thing. And this [Agyna] is your light. 

So for Agnya chakra you have to use the light. 

For this [Vishuddhi] you have to use the sky. If you put your hands up like this‚ if you say‚ ""Allah hu Akbar"" [and] put both the hands towards the sky‚ like that. There are so many ways of using the sky‚ watching the sky‚ looking at the sky. 

And for this [Agnya] the sun and the light is to be used.

Now supposing you are suffering from a Left side problem‚ if you're possessed or something‚ then you can use the sun because the sun will give you the balance.

But if you have the Right side problems‚ like ego and all that‚ you should use the moon‚ put the left hand towards the moon. 

But always people do the other way round: these dramatic melodramatic people‚ all of them will go to the lunar side: they like the moonlight. And those who are egoistical will go in the sun and burn themselves off. So other way round it should be. Like that if you use‚ you can work it out. All right? You yourself can manage it.

So these are different centres which must be cleansed and meditated onto‚ or to be dissolved into their own [elements]. I mean‚ if you dissolve them into their own element‚ then you get more strength into that particular body.

17600,,,"Shri Mataji""s advice on candle treatment"," The Left hand side people are the people‚ as you know‚ are the ones who are docile‚ who bear up lots of things from others and cry and weep and all the time are on the losers end. Such people have problems also because all their organs are lethargic and they have problems of a lethargic heart‚ lethargic liver‚ lethargic intestines. Everything becomes very lethargic. All these Left-side things can be cured. Plus they might have some sort of a badha in them‚ in the sense they are possessed by someone. Of course‚ some of them are possessed by Right-side also. Not that only the Left-side is possessed. But from the Right-side also they are possessed. And Left-sided possessions are of a peculiar type‚ because they give you pain in the body. You get pains in the body. A Right-sided person doesn't get any pain himself‚ he gives pain to others. He is very sarcastic‚ he is very aggressive. He troubles others. But the Left-sided people have pains themselves. They get a pain here and a pain there and pain here.

So the Left-side has to be cleared‚ as you know very well through the light. Light is put before the photograph‚ left hand towards the photograph‚ right hand on the Mother Earth. So the left hand gets the light and the light passes through and the negativity of the Left side passes through the right hand‚ and the right hand is on the Mother Earth.

17620,,,Advice on Right-side," So first of all you have to ascertain about yourself. ""Am I ascending? Am I transforming? Am I giving up all my bad habits? Am I getting rid of my temper? Am I getting peaceful? Am I now sweet? Or am I now still the same horrible criticiser of others?""

Just put your attention to yourself and see for yourself. It's like a mirror. You start seeing yourself in the mirror‚ what's wrong with you. And then you try to correct it.

Now second point is that you must see your vibrations‚ what centres you are catching‚ yourself. For that you have to give yourself a bandhan. You give yourself a bandhan and see for yourself what's wrong with you. When you give yourself a bandhan you will know about your chakras. And you will be amazed. I have known some people who found out they had cancer. Through centres they could say‚ ""Mother we must be having cancer!"" And then it was discovered in time and we could manage it very well‚ because they themselves found it. And then they asked me what to do and then I told them and they got cured. And when they went to the doctors they said they had cancer. And once they cured themselves they were all right.

So‚ that is how; first pay attention to yourself! You find out what's wrong with you. Some of you might be having terrible ego. Then maybe you might be having a very bad Agnya chakra. Then you should find out‚ have you got Agnya chakra? This is ego. Then there's a very good remedy in Sahaja Yoga‚ which may look ridiculous but it's a very good remedy is to beat yourselves with shoes‚ as they know‚ is the beating with the shoes is called as a shoe treatment.

Now‚ then you have to go further. Say you find yourself that your Right side is hot. What you do is put your Right side towards the photograph and the Left side up towards the ether. The ether takes away the heat. But what actually happens is that your Right side gets the vibration and the heat is pushed towards your left and passes out into the ether. Now this heat comes from too much futuristic living. Those people who are too much futuristic‚ they have too much heat. And too much heat has to go away. And when this heat starts going away then you are amazed how it works.

For that there are various things we have to use‚ but mainly for right-sided people they should not use any light‚ at all. They should not sit in the sun. They should sit in the moonlight. They should read some poetry. They should not tie up watches. They should not look at time. They should allow the time to pass. And they should just become very‚ sort of emotional people. They should sing songs of bhakti. They should not do Hatha Yoga. There are so many things they should not do if they are right-sided.

17630,,,How Music Works on the chakra? ," Yogi: How music works on the five chakras?

Shri Mataji: All these five elements are very important in our body and they are the body of the chakras also as I have told you. So what happens that‚ when you sing the music‚ the vibrations can go through the musical sound and can excite certain chakras. For example‚ for the hrday (heart) chakra it is very good or also for the Vishuddhi chakra it is very good. Not for all the chakras. But certain chakras it does. But supposing you say a mantra‚ that's the sound‚ with beautiful music and a realised soul then it is very effective. For example‚ Ganesha you can excite him with a beautiful sloka if you are a realised soul and if your Ganesha is correct‚ you can excite the Ganesha of another person very easily‚ I mean such a person can do it.

So music‚ sound‚ all these things have an effect and we are now using that method very extensively. But supposing now‚ we go in a mass meditation and many people are there and some chakra is caught‚ say Vishuddhi is caught‚ I can correct their Vishuddhi by just putting My finger on this‚ like this‚ because this has the sound‚ this is in the chakras‚ there is a micro-sound which is carrying the vibrations. Actually the part of the vibrations is the micro-sound also‚ micro-light‚ micro-sound and all the five elements are micro there. So when I put my finger the micro sound can carry the rest of them and the person can be corrected. We can do it. Specially Vishuddhi. Very easy to correct Vishuddhi on that. You can correct most of the things but certain things are very easily corrected. Vishuddhi‚ which is responsible for the sound‚ made from the sound element.

As we have seen that water element is very good for treating people for the lower chakras‚ up to the heart chakra‚ because the water and salt can help you for the Nabhi chakra because salt is the earth element and it is essence of the ocean and the essence of the ocean is in the bhavasagara. So we can use salt water for clearing the lower chakras. We can use light for the eyes because‚ this is made out of the prakash‚ the light‚ light element.

Like that different things can be done. And with these different elements if you use them‚ you can make all the dirt or all the obstructions‚ which are collected in your particular chakra by putting them back into the same element and cleansing them out so the element takes it away.

For Mother Earth also‚ She has so many elements in Her that She can take away so many of your problems which are troubling you‚ in your being‚ because of some imbalance of the Mother Earth element. This is all due to the imbalance of these elements in you‚ accumulated more beyond than what you want it. That's why I said‚ ""the extreme of it.""

Bhu tattwa (Earth element) is expressed through Shri Ganesh and Shri Ganesh is the form of the purified principle of the Earth element and is the same. In a flute you have two notes -the first and the last are the same. In the same way in a human being the seven notes‚ the first one is a Ganesha and the last one is also a Ganesha. So these seven notes are the same. And these seven notes make the Earth element and not completely Earth element but started with earth element purified. When it loses its Earth element problems completely it is Parabrahma‚ it becomes all Brahma. Because Earth element is‚ outside is the Earth element but inside is dhara‚ is dhara‚ is dharana – is the power to sustain‚ is the power to sustain. And that power is the purest form of Earth principle (tattwa). So‚ that you become later on; gradually the whole Earth element drops down and you become that.

So it is the dharana shakti as they call it: the power of sustenance. Is the Ganesha. So‚ like that‚ in every chakra you have a very subtle and subtle-most point. And that subtle-most point is the note that the Divine is playing at that point‚ because every note has a different frequency‚ a different intonation‚ a different sound‚ which helps in the melody of this Universe.

So‚ like that‚ we have seven chakras and the seven notes. And they are different notes but these notes then create permutations and combinations and that is how a chakra gets into a swara (musical note) and then it becomes a sound‚ and from a sound it becomes a word‚ and from word it becomes a language and like that it goes on and the same subtle form starts becoming something else. For example if I have love for my children: how [do] I express it? I make a house for them‚ I make a place to live for them‚ I cook food for them‚ I make a bed for them. It's a gross expression of that subtle love I have. In the same way whatever is subtle within us is expressed outside with the help of the elements that are outside‚ to express the subtle through our gross behaviour or gross material things we do.

So‚ it's the same subtle which is expressing outside. But then we become so gross later on that we forget the inner part of it. A Mother may create something‚ all these things and then she becomes so possessive of her children‚ she'll think‚ ""I've done so much for my children‚"" that she wouldn't even think why she has made it! She forgets the love part of it and she becomes nothing but the gross thing. She just starts scolding the children‚ even for breaking a small thing here and there. She does this for love‚ and then she forgets it. That's what is an extreme behaviour. Extreme behaviour means‚ from the subtle‚ you get to the gross and the gross‚ and the grosser. Once you become grosser you are dead  ...""",,,,,,,,Vishuddhi,,,,Ganesha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So‚ in action you do like that. 

Now as He is the 'essence' of everything that is material‚ that has bhava‚ that has been created. He is the essence of everything that has been created. 'Through Him' everything has been created. You‚ when you develop that‚ you develop your sense of subtle creativity‚ and the sense of subtle appreciation of creativity.

17950,,,Astrology,"..They said that there is a Suryagrahana‚ means the eclipse of the sun and if today is such a great date‚ that if you do the worship or the puja you get blessings of thousands of such pujas on an eclipse day of the sun. Now‚ if you look at it‚ it looks very fine‚ good‚ yes it's true‚ it is written in the astrological survey and all that – is a very great thing‚ and we start following it. You being Sahaja yogis‚ you must attack it from a subtler point. That is how your wisdom will also become subtler; your attitude also will become subtler. To attack such a question from subtle point of view‚ we have to first of all know that we are Sahaja yogis. No technique is needed‚ just see your vibrations on this question‚ to begin with – it's very simple. Subtler things are the simpler things; gross things are complicated – it is very simple‚ very simple equation. Simple thing is to feel the vibrations on this point – whether today's puja‚ is it really worth something or not. You'll be amazed that your Right side will become hot on this point.

So‚ this intellect‚ which is now being enlightened‚ prabuddha you have become‚ you must use it in a subtler way. Why‚ that for Sahaja yogis‚ it is not necessary to do the puja today? You have already become thoughtless‚ so I will not ask you to answer the question. The reason is‚ as you are all technocrats‚ you are right-sided. This was all right thousands of years back‚ when the Vedas started‚ and the Vedas have given us the science. All the excitement about Vedas was all right at that time when they worshiped the Surya or the right-sided things… ",https://www.amruta.org/p/6820,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So now how to decide at that point? Still there are temperaments in a subtler way still hanging on so for marriage‚ one has to know what sort of a person will be congenial. The same person may not be happy with the other one and the same may be happy with another one. So that is‚ has to be judged. Now then another thing is that you lead a very normal life‚ you become extremely normal person‚ extremely normal. There's nothing abnormal about it  ... ,https://www.amruta.org/p/6938,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17970,,,Attention,"  ...So the thing is that now as you have become the channels of God‚ the energy is sucked in by other people who are sitting around or those who are in that place or who are working there very hard. It's perfectly all right because you have chosen to be the channels. But if the channel is completely dragged in the sense that if everything gets exhausted you also feel the drain for the time being. But at that time it's a very simple technique‚ a Divine technique which we should remember‚ that the source of our energy comes from the Spirit which resides in our heart. At this time if you say‚ ""I am the Spirit‚ I am not this physical being. Why should I be drained out? I am the Spirit."" You can put your hand‚ if you want‚ on your Heart or you can [circle] your hand around your Heart like this [bandhan] so that you start bringing your Spirit into your attention and the attention that is dragged outside becomes completely nourished. 

One must know that Kundalini is the nourishing thing for you. As soon as you start bringing the Spirit in your attention the Kundalini rises. When She rises‚ She gives strength to your physical being. You know that these chakras are made out of the elements. The first two chakras are made out of the Mother Earth. So the Mother Earth is a very important thing for us. For such people who feel they are dragged down in their physical energies you must try to sit on the Mother Earth and request Her to give you strength  ...

17980,,,Attention,"  ...But for a Sahaja Yogi the most important thing is: you must save your attention. It's called as Chitta Nirodha. Nirodh. It's saving of your attention. ""Where is it going? It's such a precious thing for me. Where is it running?"" Then how do you save your attention? Is through concentration. Concentrate! Try to concentrate. Don't allow your attention to wobble. Gradually you will develop concentration. You can watch my photograph – it's the best. Concentrate. Bring it in your heart. Let it be integrated in your heart. You are lucky people‚ you don't have to build up a photograph‚ and then give it up because it is just a avalambana‚ means it's just a dependence‚ and then you remove it. It's a complete dependence for you and a load for me‚ of complete joy.

First you allow your attention to be absolutely free‚ all right? Then the Kundalini rises. She rises and comes out of your Brahmarandra‚ as we call it. In case your attention is very wobbly‚ then we'll say that pay attention here a little bit. But there's no need at all. The Kundalini comes up and She breaks through. You have to leave your attention little loose‚ not to bother about it. But later on what happens that when supposing you have a Nabhi problem‚ as you were saying‚ in the solar plexus you have a problem‚ the Kundalini will again go back and hit there‚ and your attention will be drawn automatically. You don't have to pay attention to it. You will‚ you will be drawn. Then by your attention you can raise the Kundalini. So you don't have to concentrate anywhere  ...,https://www.amruta.org/p/6644,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now‚ the Bindu and this and that are higher stages. Ardha Bindu‚ than Bindu and then Valaya. But you should not be futuristic‚ just now if you have read some book no use trying to show off that.

Agnya is yellow‚ yellow-covered as we say‚ like a gold cap is the Agnya there‚ beautiful Agnya is inside. 

Now the fruit of the lotus is later on we see‚ and I would say that is called as Bindu state‚ where you become a bindu – a dot‚ it's a little dot – and that dot has to then grow. So it's the second stage starts when you become the fruit of the lotus. 

You see‚ I don't think you should worry too much about these. There's three stages higher than Sahastrara. I would suggest just now let us concentrate on Sahastrara‚ is a better idea.

18050,,,Granthies,"  ...you have to break certain knots they call it Granthi in the Sanskrit language‚ which are giving you this falsehood in the meantime… 

  ...This knot‚ I mean‚ you see there is a big controversy about names. I would not like you to confuse it but we can say like that‚ this knot is a knot which is a knot between the spirit and the matter which is called as [Jad-prakruthi] in the Sanskrit language. 

  ...one Granthi or you can call it this knot of the Jad-Prakruthi or what you call as this matter… 

  ...Shankaracharya has called Brahma-granthi he calls it Brahma-granthi. Brahma-granthi because the Brahma is the vibrating force‚ Brahma‚ AUM. That is the vibrating force because it's the vibrations as they called it of the Brahma-granthi.

Now the second one (Vishnu-granthi) is the one by which we think that we can do something. 

Now this one is the superego one‚ the first one I told you about creates the superego‚ this Granthi‚ the knot. How do you have a knot? I'll give you an example of a balloon. Say for example‚ a balloon. Now a balloon has lots of air in it but it will all pass out‚ it won't be there if there is no knot there. You see but if there is a knot which can hold the balloon‚ alright. And this is the balloon we have in our head which we call a superego which we can see here clearly‚ can you show that? The black one‚ you know the black. You know what is this one is the superego by which you see you get possessed‚ you get all mad and you do all kinds of things. This is the Brahma-granthi. This knot is there. And this knot‚ you see it first starts at the Mooladhara down. It starts from there. The knot starts from there‚ can you imagine? It starts from there! Because this one is made of Prithvi-tatwa it's made of the earth element. So from the very beginning from the earth element itself‚ the knot starts. But as there's a knot you see when you make a knot always there is an unwinding‚ always. You come by a staircase you always can go down. Is there a staircase by which you can not go down but only come up? In the same way‚ if you have made a knot there must be a way of going out of the knot you see. So the going out of the knot is worked out through Sahaja Yoga; that also is done through vibrations that the first‚ this knot has to be released. Once this knot is released then only the Kundalini starts. This is the first knot‚ is much more important  ... 

  ...so this materialism works out and this Granthi‚ what I call the Brahma-granthi‚ is the involvement or you can say the falsehood‚ the falsehood of matter; the falsehood of matter works through this and one goes on believing it and believing it… 

  ...But normally by doing it outside‚ artificially doing something‚ you see this is another kind of a Granthi‚ they call a knot; and this knot starts by identifying yourself by thinking that if you do something then you are going to achieve by sort of doing some sort of an effort or by doing some sort of a penance or sort of standing on your heads or so called Hatha Yoga… 

  ...All the time you are playing with these two knots within you Rajo-guna and Tamo-guna. These two knots are within you and that's why your attention is not on the spirit… 

  ...And this wisdom can not come until this lowest Granthi breaks‚ the lowest knot breaks‚ where a person starts understanding one simple point that human beings cannot do it. God has to do it. So the surrendering starts  ... ",https://www.amruta.org/p/5527,,,,,,,Muladhara,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

18070,,,Granthies,"..The transition from one state to the next higher state seems to be similar to opening a difficult gate or undergoing a tied up knot – Granthi.

The body consciousness of Vishwa seems to extend up to Swadisthana and there is placed the Brahma-Granthi or – knot. Brahma-Granthi there. 

From this the next state of consciousness of Jīva called Tejasa extends above Anahata‚ where the Vishnu-Granthi is placed – see Brahma- Granthi and then Vishnu-Granthi is placed. Granthi means when two things bind together. So it is between Vishuddhi and Heart this Granthi takes place – Vishnu-Granthi. 

This state of consciousness of Jīva called Prāgñā similar to dreamlessly extends to Agnya‚ above which is Rudra-Granthi. Between this is Turīya state‚ where individual and cosmic consciousness unite.

But nobody makes that study. Try to make the study‚ ""What makes Mother pleased"". Then you will see‚ I'm very easily pleased‚ you see. As a Shiva tattwa.

Even if you make mistakes try to pull your ears‚ alright. But don't go too far with it. You see‚ the mistakes you commit is alright‚ but don't take it for granted that you can go on committing mistakes. Because you really get a big rope‚ but you will hang yourself ultimately‚ isn't it? So be afraid of the rope also which is given to you‚ it will hang you much better otherwise.

So one has to understand that you should not be addicted to public opinion or to the opinion of your own. Both things are wrong. You must behave in such a manner that it should please all the deities within Me‚ as far as I am concerned I don't exist.

18550,,,To cross Agnya you have to meditate,"Now one thing is there‚ obstructing Sahasrara‚ is the movement of your Agnya into thoughts. That is the only thing- that is the only thing that stops your entry into Sahaja Yoga.

Thoughts are coming all the time because a human being is born who reacts to everything. React to this and react to that and thoughts coming and thoughts go. There is a big crowd of thoughts because of that your attention cannot cross over Agnya and cannot reside in the Sahasrara.

So first of all one should see‚ what sort of thoughts are coming. You have to condemn yourself sometimes. You have to say: ""What nonsense. What have I been doing? What is the matter with me? How could I do all that?"" Once you start doing that‚ these thoughts will start disappearing.

These thoughts are coming from two angle: one from the ego and another from your conditionings. And these are so much built up within you that they don""t allow your Agnya to be crossed. That is why we have two Bija Mantras of HAM‚ KSHAM.

First one is when it is conditioning. You are endowed with this kind of fear: ""I should not do like this. I should not do like that. This is not allowed. That is not allowed."" That is the conditioning part of it. Conditioning can be of many types. But the ego part is that ""I must overpower everybody. I must get this. I must be able to rule everyone.""

These two things are there in the mind‚ which are all the time crossing. So it is important that we should go into thoughtless awareness and that thoughtless awareness is the real way that your Sahasrara can be nourished by the Kundalini. Because Kundalini cannot go through‚ cannot pass through and for that‚ as I said‚ there are two Bija Mantras. One is HAM. Another is KSHAM.

So if you are conditioned‚ you are frightened‚ you are afraid and you have ideas about yourself. These days the way people are describing: They say: ""I am an extrovert."" Somebody will say: ""I am an introvert."" Somebody will say: ""I am hippy.. I am that.. I am that..""

All kinds of things they can have attributed to themselves. But these ideas are all coming from outside‚ they are not from inside. To get to the inner side of yourself‚ the subtler side of your being‚ you must allow the Kundalini to go through the Agnya.

To cross the Agnya is a very important thing in modern times. And for that you have to meditate. If you can meditate with complete faith in yourself‚ this Agnya can be opened up. With surrendering to the Divine‚ you have to surrender yourself to the Divine and when this Agnya opens‚ you will be amazed. Your Sahasrara is just waiting to transfer‚ to give you all the help that you need through the all pervading power.

Your connection of Sahasrara with the all pervading power is established and by that you will be amazed how all these seven chakras work for you‚ how they help you‚ how they try to give you whatever is the real knowledge about everything. This real knowledge that you get is very joy giving.

You can see this real knowledge in everything. You don""t have to start reading any book about it. In every situation and in every person‚ in every flower‚ in every natural happening‚ you see clearly the hand of the Divine. Once you see the hand of the Divine‚ your ego start disappearing‚ once you say that: ""It is you. You do everything.""

Kabira has said something great about this. He said that when the goat is alive‚ it goes on saying I am‚ ma ma‚ I am‚ I am. But when it is slaughtered and its intestines are made into strings‚ which are used for cleaning the cotton‚ then it said tuhi‚ tuhi‚ you are‚ you are. See in this symbolic way‚ they have suggested that you have to become the‚ dissolved into this divine power. It is the divine power that does everything.

What am I? I was just a drop and I fell into this ocean of awareness of the divine power and that is taking over and working it out. That will help you a lot to be a great Sahaja Yogi.",whttps://www.amruta.org/p/243,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18560,,,Sahasrara opening is very important,"Only your Sahasrara can reflect the light of the divine. So your Sahasrara is extremely important. You must meditate to enrich your Sahasrara‚ to cure it‚ to make it completely nourished by the Kundalini.

There is no need to do many rituals but meditation and also little bit of taking bandhan‚ even now‚ today is necessary I think when you go out because still Kaliyuga is working its own pangs and the Satyayuga is trying to come up.

We are the ones who are going to support‚ look after the Satyayuga and that's why the Sahasrara opening is very‚ very important. It is very important and those who want to grow should meditate every day. Whatever time you may come home‚ may be in the morning may be in the evening‚ any time but you will know that you are meditating when you can get into thoughtless awareness.

Then you will know‚ your reaction will be zero. Look at something‚ you will just look at it‚ you won't react because you are thoughtless. You won't react‚ when that reaction is not there‚ then everything‚ you""ll be surprised‚ is divine‚ because reaction is your Agnya's problem.

Once you are absolutely thoughtlessly aware‚ you are one with the divine. So much so that Divine takes over every activity‚ every moment of your life and looks after it and you feel completely secured‚ one with the Divine and enjoy the blessings of the Divine.

May God bless You!",whttps://www.amruta.org/p/243,,,,,,,Sahasrara,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18570,http://nirmalvidya.blogspot.com/2008/09/quotes-of-shri-mataji.html,,When we meditate we go into Thoughtless Awareness,"First to get Self-Realisation and then to be aware of your position. Then you'll be surprised how you develop proper attention and proper understanding.

Absolutely‚ it is an easy thing to do as soon as you find that you have achieved that witness- state. So please try to make yourself a witness. When you see something‚ go into thoughtless awareness. That is your fort. Don't think. See the beauty that is there‚ just pouring in‚ just watch how these tree are standing still just watching you all. See‚ absolutely still‚ nothing is moving. They don't even allow one leaf to move……let it be. Till the breeze‚ till then we just keep quiet and watch. Like these mountains how they are steadily watching everything and emitting joy and beauty. In the same way‚ we have to become witness. We need not talk too much‚ we need not keep quiet but in the center we should witness the whole thing as 'Leela'. That's why He is called 'Leeladhara'‚ means the one who sustains the Leela of persons.

It doesn't make you mad‚ it doesn't make you funny‚ but it makes you joyous. Anything that makes you joyous is the Vishnu principle of Shri Krishna. I hope all of us are going to enjoy our Vishnu principle hereafter as we have enjoyed before by meditating. Because when we meditate we go into Thoughtless Awareness. When we are in Thoughtless Awareness‚ then only we grow‚ otherwise we cannot grow. Whatever we may try we cannot grow. Unless and until we meditate we cannot become Thoughtlessly Aware.

All those who also want to gain in any walk of life‚ in any dimension‚ those who want to become‚ say‚ great artists‚ great scientists‚ great anything have to meditate. In Sahaja Yoga it is important you must meditate‚ otherwise the kundalini will come down and you will lose all your talents.

Now this is the one point which is very important. If you have to grow‚ you should be absolutely in connection with Divine through thoughtless awareness. You don't have to pray. You don't have to call anyone – nothing. It just works because it is within you.

All these thoughts are bombarding you from both the sides in your mind. These thoughts that are coming to you‚ have no meaning with you. They do not substantiate you.

But in God""s own Kingdom‚ there is no planning. You sit down and just enjoy. If your attention is there all the work is done‚ full attention; and then he take out work and give full priority to that do not compromise your way through. You have to help others also to come up and so you must remember for that also your attention should be on your Atma‚ On your Spirit‚ on God‚ completely One with Him in that joy. The whole heart is there and with your both hands and your both feet‚ with all your attention you can pull out people because your attention is all the time fed‚ nurtured and looked after‚ then you will enjoy also the lifting of the people. Nothing can be alright unless and until you develop the subtleties of your attention; and they develop by receding your attention from all that is gross. Recede your attention whenever it goes too much into a thought‚ like that - ""Oh‚ forget it"". But into vibrations you pay full attention‚ seeing vibrations you pay full attention‚ seeing your own vibrations pay full attention‚ other things you need not worry they will be all looked after.

That is how your attention is subtler in the kingdom of God. When the lotus is in the mud and it has to come out it finds its way through many crevices and many holes in that mud but when it is out in the open - absolutely liberated free then it does not go on dashing here and there but just opens out and receives the beautiful dew‚ and the dew melts the fragrance in the lotus.

18600,,,If there's a thought you cannot enjoy,"First of all our eyes are not steady‚ they go on hovering from here to there‚ God knows what we are looking for. The eyes become impure because we start thinking about things‚ as soon as we see something we start thinking and a barrier is created. For example there is a beautiful piece something very beautiful you see‚ and looking at it if there's a thought you cannot enjoy. But if there is no thought‚ there's pure rapport‚ pure connection‚ between that beautiful art and yourself‚ then you just see it and enjoy that joy of the artist which he has poured into it‚ without thinking about it. Otherwise normally people will think‚ ""How many pounds can I save?"" or ""What should I do? Should I purchase it or not?"" All sorts of nonsensical flippant‚ cheap ideas can come into your head. Or could be something higher also ""This color is not matched with that and this."" But a person who is a realized soul will just see‚ just like children‚ they just look‚ in the same way‚ without thinking.

18610,,,Turiya,"  most important for all of us is to know that there""s a nadi which passes through left Vishuddhi into the heart. Starts from the heart‚ goes up‚ passes through Agnya. It has four petals‚ opens up. This is the one which gives you the state which is called as Turiya.

We live in three states. In the living - in the awakened state‚ jagruti - our attention goes to this‚ that‚ and all that‚ we spoil our attention.

But the second one is the one what we call is that we sleep. When we sleep also all these things that have happened come to us from our past and things like that.But then we go to the deeper sleep called as sushupti. Is a state where you have deep sleep‚ and you dream of something that is reality also. You may dream about me. Like it""s the ethereal part of the subconscious where some beautiful informations are passed. Supposing I""ve come‚ say‚ to Italy. Italians might know in their sushupti that I have come here or maybe anybody might know‚ depends on.

But the fourth state is called as Turiya. There are two more states. You are in the Turiya state‚ is the fourth. Turiya means fourth. Fourth state is where‚ that you are in a thoughtless awareness state. When there is no thought - just think of it - when there is no thought you have to be innocent. When there is no thought you have to have vibrations. When there is no thought you cannot be attached to anyone. So into that thoughtless state you have come now‚ is the Turiya disthuti. And in this state‚ when you are‚ these four petals which are within you have to open out in your brain. They come from your heart to your brain. And that is when you absolutely understand what is God. Absolutely know what is God is. That is the time when one receives the real knowledge. But unless and until these four petals open one may fall back.""",whttps://www.amruta.org/p/638,,About meditation,,,,,Left Vishuddhi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because some people are such that they start on the left‚ go to the right‚ they become so ego-oriented that it's impossible to deal with. But if you stay in the centre‚ that's the fourth side‚ is staying in the centre. Turiya is the fourth dimension. If you could stay on that then you become a witness. And that's the point where you start sucking the joy of every moment.

Now the reflection — supposing you take an Indian mirror; you look in the mirror and you'll find you look like nothing on earth‚ it will just cut you into three pieces‚ maybe‚ or anything. But if you take a Belgian mirror‚ say‚ then the reflection is correct‚ full – but still not three dimensional. But this is a four dimensional reflection — four dimensional it is‚ what is called as turiya state. And that four dimensional personality you have reflected because of your reflector of your desire. The reflector is the desire and the reflection is complete.""",whttps://www.amruta.org/p/1512,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18640,,,Turiya,"""Turiya is the fourth state. In the fourth state you dominate these three gunas‚ you control all the elements. At this stage‚ you just say and it works. You have seen yesterday what happened with me. It just works‚ you become master of these three gunas. Like I used to describe that first you are sitting in the car and somebody""s driving you. He uses your left and Right side‚ or you can say‚ the brake and accelerator‚ and the car is driven. Then he starts teaching you how to drive. Then you start learning by using your left and right‚ accelerator and your brake. Then the third stage comes in where you become a driver‚ but still you are worried about the master who is sitting behind‚ that still you are doing a mistake‚ you are doing wrong. But then the fourth stage comes‚ you become the master. You make others drive. Order here‚ anyone‚ order the Sun‚ order the Moon‚ order. Order means just tell them‚ I mean not question of any domination is there. Just desire. Just say it‚ it works out. Now this fourth stage is called as Turiya Dasha.

Then comes the fifth stage in which - I don""t want to give you names because you'll stick on to those. They are not so clear cut. They mingle from each other you see‚ and they are mixtures. But in Turiya state when you mature properly‚ then you jump into the fifth state‚ in which you do not even‚ you do Sankalpa. You do not even determine or say anything. You just‚ anything slips out of your mouth‚ may not even slip out - it works. Is a state. There you handle the whole situation‚ sitting down here.

Sitting down here‚ you know each and every thing. Then not only you have mastered it‚ but in that you can enter into it. Now‚ for example‚ I'll tell you what. I can enter into your subconscious‚ into your collective subconscious‚ into your supraconscious‚ into all the areas you see‚ I can if I want to. This is when you have mastered it completely‚ then you enter into it. When you are the master‚ then you enter into it. When you""re master of this house‚ you can enter into any place.Then comes the seventh state and that is the state where you‚ just you are. Your being there is sufficient. Just being there. Nothing exists‚ but you - for yourself. Now all these seven states you can reach‚ because I stand beyond them and I have come down to the first state. I""m trying to pull you out. If you do not drag me down‚ I can pull you up very fast. So only request is don""t drag me down.""",whttps://www.amruta.org/p/4614,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

18670,What are vibrations,,,The principle of Ganesha is extremely subtle‚ is the subtlest of subtle. And it exists in everything‚ that it exists in the matter in the form of vibrations. There is no matter which is without vibrations. It has vibrations which are seen even in the atoms and also in the molecules of all matter that has existed. So Shri Ganesha is the first one who was established in the matter‚ as well. As a result we can see‚ He exists in the sun‚ He exists in the moon‚ He exists in the whole universe‚ in the whole creation‚ and He continues to exist in human beings also.,https://www.amruta.org/p/1420,,,,,,,,,,,Ganesha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Qualities,,
18680,What are vibrations,,,"Unless and until you are connected completely we cannot understand collectivity of innocence. The collectivity of innocence‚ I see sometimes‚ I am very happy that a child of somebody is in the lap of somebody‚ sitting very sweetly‚ coming as if he is your own father‚ coming and sitting just on your lap without knowing that‚ ""He's not my father."" But still that consciousness is not there. So this breaks the feeling of my and possession‚ that ""This is mine‚ this is mine."" And what makes the feeling that we are now a means‚ a means‚ we can say‚ an instrument‚ a media by which we express the Ganesha Tattwa all over‚ that is vibrations. So the vibrations itself about which you are asking‚ these vibrations themselves are nothing but the Principle of Shri Ganesha. He's Omkara. And when it is‚ then what is it‚ that feeling as I told you‚ the vatsalya‚ the feeling of love between a child and a mother. That feeling‚ it is the one that is vibra- tions between the child and the mother. The distance between the two is vibrations and that's what one has to feel – that he's a child still and there is the mother and mother is bringing the child‚ giving all the powers to the child‚ bringing up‚ loving the child‚ understanding the limitations of the child‚ looking after‚ all that.

So when it becomes the relationship be- tween you and God‚ then there are vibrations and then that same rela- tionship should extend to everything that you do. You should see what things are good‚ whatever has got vibrations. Now today I want to tell you something very important about this all-per- vading power we heard about‚ these are nothing but vibrations. Param- chaitanya is nothing but vibrations‚ where all identities are lost – where the mother is lost‚ father is lost‚ we can say – nothing remains when it is just this vibrations‚ this subtle vatsalya exists. That's all. And this is the only thing out of which everything comes and remains in itself. Like we can say that the suns rays come out and then they try to create chloro- phyll. So it's not that we cannot compare sun with that. Or we can say‚ from the ocean the clouds come out and they try to nourish the Mother Earth. That's also – cannot be compared. Everything is inside. This Para- machaitanya has got everything inside. So we can say that everything is nothing but knowledge‚ is nothing but truth‚ is nothing but light.,https://www.amruta.org/p/1420,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But as realised souls‚ you are empowered‚ now you can ask water‚ ""Alright‚ you dissolve this‚ you do this‚ you do that."" But for that‚ it is important to be the masters. And to become the masters‚ you see‚ like a matter becomes a human being‚ and from human being you have to become the masters of the matter and you handle the matter So we come back to the same. Like agriculture‚ we can handle‚ just vibrate it. We can handle water‚ we can handle the sun‚ we can handle moon -because there's a rapport. Now we are aware a rapport has been established‚ so all this play is extremely beautiful to Me. I see it.

So‚ this we can see with our naked eyes‚ if you want to see‚ even if you are realised or not. From where do these vibrations come in the minutest paramanu‚ as you call‚ the molecules? In a molecule‚ how do you get these vibrations‚ can you explain this? It is so much‚ sukshma‚ parasukshma.

If you do not take to Sahaja Yoga‚ gradually you'll find your vibrations will be lost after some time‚ because God doesn't want to waste His vibrations on people who do not want to give it to others.,https://www.amruta.org/p/4544,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18790,What are vibrations,,,You have seen Kundalini moving. You have seen its pulsation. You have felt the vibrations. Now‚ anybody who talks about against Sahaja Yoga is very easy‚ anybody can‚ any Dick‚ Tom and Harry can say‚ very easy to criticize anything‚ very easy because how much does it take? You don't need any capital for that. You need not be knowing a word about Kund- alini. Some might say it's a myth‚ it's a psychological thing; all kinds of nonsense they will say. But if you are a serious people‚ then you must understand that you have felt the vibrations‚ they are there‚ and that you are going to proceed further. It is for your own good and for your own asking you should get it. If there are certain problems on your chakras they must be corrected.,https://www.amruta.org/p/4544,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18800,What are vibrations,,,Have you ever seen any Kundalini pulsating before? I will show you the pulsation of a Kundalini. You have never heard that there are on the fin- gers anywhere the vibrations are coming‚ nothing‚ but you have felt it not only but you can diagnose a person. You can tell a person what he's suffering from. You can cure a person.,https://www.amruta.org/p/4544,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18810,What are vibrations,,,By God's grace you have got vibrations. This is a very big thing. Those who haven't got will also get it. I would request you every day you have to sit on the water for seven days to see that you are cleared out now after real- ization and also later on whenever you are tired. It's better; that's a bath for you. Every day do that treatment yourself. It's a bath. You cleanse yourself because you gather. I do not gather. I‚ nothing happens to Me‚ but it happens to you. So you must have a bath in the night‚ take out all the problems on that water‚ throw it away. Water with salt is a sea which takes away all your problems.,https://www.amruta.org/p/4544,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18820,What are vibrations,,,The photo has the vibrations; is a fact. Also‚ there are many things that have vibrations. For example‚ even this statue has got vibrations. Even these two statues have‚ but not so much as they are from Me. First of all‚ I am a living being. Another is that their proportions may be wrong because they are created by human beings‚ by their imagination‚ but the swayam- bhu lingaas‚ all of them have got. For example‚ now supposing you have a prostate gland problem‚ if you go to the‚ say‚ to any of these [Mother speaks in Marathi] Raanjhan gaaon‚ Raanjhan gaaon Ganapati. You see‚ I went there. It has complete vibrations. [Unclear: Chichwaara?] because it is‚ you see‚ too much visited by people. So it gets crowded sometimes‚ but Raanjhan gaaon I found still all right; but as soon I say Raanjhan gaaon everybody will go to Raanjhan gaaon and the Raanjhan gaaon also will be [unclear] because after all these are the‚ these are the special statues which have come out by Mother Earth. She's thrown them. Mother Earth thinks‚ She creates these things and She throws these things and they give vibrations. So you take vibrations from them all. But My photograph is a photograph as a reality.,https://www.amruta.org/p/4544,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18830,What are vibrations,,,"First question is about what are these vibrations. I told you yesterday that in our heart there is a flicker of light which is burning all the time‚ which is the Atma which is the reflection of Paramatma in our heart. In short I'll tell you; the details I will not. Now what happens‚ the Kundalini ris- es‚ she opens the Brahmarandhra and there is the seat of the Sadashiva‚ the peetha. You see‚ the peetha is here‚ but Shiva is in the heart reflected as the Atma. You see the peetha and the peetha is created because‚ you see‚ the peetha receives the subtle‚ you see. It receives the subtle energy which is all-pervading‚ the gross. Inside all the pervading‚ for example‚ this collects My voice. Voice is a subtle energy which is collected through this. Here now we have all kinds of pictures and all kinds of music going on‚ but if you have a radio it can capture. In the same way the peethas are in the brain and the peetha of the Sadashiva is higher up here which is opened out so that the subtle‚ the sukshama in the gross passes into our heart through a very subtle channel and just like a gas light it has a flicker and when the gas opens out the prakaashsa comes in. Now the vibrations are‚ are the‚ that prakaasha going through us.
These vibrations start flowing through us. Now what do I do? You will say‚ ""Mataji what do You do?"" I do nothing but I just try to give you that force which is the‚ we can say‚ the gas power. That is the gas power because the Kundalini knows that when I am before you‚ she rises‚ she opens out and it starts flowing. It is flowing through Me throughout‚ but unless and until you are subtle you cannot feel it and you have it. It is‚ you can say that I am like a‚ you can say that I am the finite in the infinite‚ or you can say the infinite in the finite; infinite into the finite and also the finite into the infinite. I'm both.
So the energy that is emitted into all the subtle energy is passing through Me‚ is the Viraat. From the Viraat‚ say‚ the whole thing passes. It is going into the all-pervading. It is all-pervading everybody. Everywhere it is go- ing. Even it is in a cell in everything. In a carbon atom it is there. Into all atoms‚ into all arrangements it is working. It is the subtle energy that is emitted through Me. When you become subtle you become like a radio; you start receiving it. Now how will you know what is correct what is in- correct? You ask the subtle‚ and the subtle answers you‚ and you get the answers on your hands. It is like that. So these are the vibrations which you receive from the All-pervading Power and the All-pervading Power is emitted out and you receive it from Me or from the All-pervading. It's just the same from everywhere these are the vibrations.",https://www.amruta.org/p/4544,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18840,What are vibrations,,,Don'ts and dos; first and foremost things that a Sahaja yogi cannot smoke or drink. One absolutely one hundred per cent sure‚ because if you drink or smoke you will find after some time you either you'll lose your vibrations or you'll start vomiting. You cannot smoke. If you smoke your Vishuddhi will be caught. If you drink your Nabhi chakra will be caught and whenever you'll place your hand towards the photograph all the Nabhi chakra will be burning absolutely.,https://www.amruta.org/p/4544,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18850,What are vibrations,,,Do service to your parents‚ to your mothers. Don't find faults with your parents and try to be kind to them‚ also to the kind to the wife's mother parents also and try to be good in the family. Try to bring more peace if they are difficult. I mean‚ it's all right. Don't spoil the children also. Correct them‚ make them loving. Make a nice society. Every one of you should be the carrier of love of your Mother‚ everywhere. If you are Saha- ja yogis and if you change and transform in your behavior‚ naturally Sa- haja Yoga will have its own reputation and everybody will start taking to Sahaja Yoga [Mother speaks in Marathi]; impossible. If you do anything like that‚ immediately your vibrations will go away.,https://www.amruta.org/p/4544,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18860,What are vibrations,,,"And you see with your vibrations if you have to take a decision‚ ""Should I take this house or not?"" Take the vibrations. Anything you see‚ ""What should I do? Should I have‚ who should I have as a Prime Minister?"" Now‚ see for yourself whom do you want to have a Prime Minister. See four people you put in; see the vibrations. Who has the best? Now‚ you think of the person. He will not be the one the Prime Minister. You cannot say that he will be because maybe that there are so many horrible people. In a democracy anybody can be brought in but the one‚ who is a good one‚ is a Sahaja yogi. He should be the Prime Minister‚ and you should ask. If the more people ask for it‚ he may be. So decide everything with vibrations‚ for yourself‚ for collectiveness or anything‚ and the most important is you give it to others.",https://www.amruta.org/p/4544,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18870,What are vibrations,,,But what is this Divine Love? What does this do? It is the energy of the Mother. We can say it is the energy of Adi Shakti‚ which is all over‚ works through vibrations. But what are these vibrations? It's a very subtle ener- gy that starts flowing through your Sahastrara. All the thousand petals of the Sahastrara get slowly enlightened and it starts flowing throughout your body‚ throughout your hands‚ feet‚ throughout your body. And the more you are  ... I mean your attention is‚ on the Sahastrara‚ the more it works faster.,https://www.amruta.org/p/201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18880,What are vibrations,,,"Now in the science I've read that they have discovered an energy called‚ they call it  ....what you call it? What energy? Quantum ha! Quantum Energy. Quantum‚ I don't know why they call it Quantum‚ because Quantum is four. So it might be meaning the energy of Ganesha‚ maybe‚ I don't know. Because scientists are blind people‚ I don't know what they call what! So they are saying there is a quantum energy.
Now this Quantum Energy‚ according to them‚ flows‚ in a very subtle manner and it is normally not visible‚ but it has light. You have seen that in so many of photographs of Mine‚ there's light of all kind. This energy moves in a light. So this is the Quantum Energy I think again‚ I am not very sure‚ because scientists‚ I have always found them little bit vague! But this quantum energy they are talking about is something like the spiritual energy or the energy of love‚ which flows around. And this Quantum Energy‚ they do not know what it does‚ but they have seen it has got light. They call it Quantum because‚ according to them‚ it flows in bundles‚ and every bundle is a quanta‚ according to them.
Now this energy‚ when it flows‚ as you have seen yourself‚ it works. It works in every direction‚ in every dimension.",https://www.amruta.org/p/201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18890,What are vibrations,,,But all of you who have got Realisation can also work out your own ener- gies. How? By releasing it‚ by feeling it‚ by giving it to others‚ by experi- menting. Of course‚ Sahaja Yoga has spread because of you only. You are the people that have brought people to Sahaja Yoga. But that's not the end of it. We have to save this world.,https://www.amruta.org/p/201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18900,What are vibrations,,,"Now what are these vibrations? That is the love.
So the communication is like this. If you have the light you can see things. So when you see things‚ the light is there and light gives you the percep- tion‚ gives you the vision to see things. In the same way‚ when you are en- lightened‚ what happens is that these vibrations start flowing – just like the light‚ and in that light you can see things which are good and which are bad. But sometimes you put the same parameters as human beings do. Like you go to some house‚ a very nice house‚ a very good house – all these things make you very happy. But actually what about that house? Is it having good vibrations or is it having bad vibrations‚ is it worth living there or not?
Like the other day they told me that they can get a very nice place in Milano‚ a little beyond Milano‚ for rent‚ very cheap. I said ""Why is it so cheap?"" Immediately I felt the vibrations of the place. I said ""Did you go and see the vibrations of that place?"" They went and saw – it was all burning.",https://www.amruta.org/p/201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18910,What are vibrations,,,So in your judgement‚ what is there? There is no Pure Knowledge. So see how connected they are: vibrations which is love and also the other thing which you have to have is the knowledge‚ the Pure Knowledge‚ the True Knowledge. We can say that Pure Knowledge and the True Knowledge is like the energy‚ like electricity. And the way you feel it‚ the way you un- derstand it‚ it exists‚ that is love.,https://www.amruta.org/p/201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18920,What are vibrations,,,"The knowledge‚ as I told you‚ Pure Knowledge‚ is that which gives you a pure light. A pure light means pure vibrations. Now vibrations can be misleading‚ as I told you‚ or could be the quantity of vibrations can be less or more. There's another way to see it‚ is to see for yourself‚ ""Why do you want to do a particular thing?"" Mental also – you can also use param- eter of mental understanding. ""Why do I want to do it?"" ""What is the gain for all the people?"" If you start thinking from that angle‚ that: ""What is the gain for others? What will they gain by this? Why should I do it?"" You'll be amazed‚ you will get the real picture of what you are doing.
So you must keep yourself all the time in a state where you witness your- self. You see yourself‚ that‚ ""Why am I doing this? What is the purpose?"" Sometimes this could be some conditioning‚ could be some sort of a psy- chological thing‚ could be anything. But if you start watching carefully‚ ""Why I am doing it?"" You'll be amazed that your vibrations itself will start telling you on your fingertips.",https://www.amruta.org/p/201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18930,What are vibrations,,,I have told you‚ the other day that these vibrations are nothing but the Brahmashakti‚ the power of Brahma. The power of Brahma is the power that creates‚ that desires‚ that evolves and it gives the living force also.,https://www.amruta.org/p/4656,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18940,What are vibrations,,,We do not see to the needs of the Spirit. By seeing to the needs of the spirit‚ you can overcome the Left side. You start looking after your spirit from which you know that you get your vibrations.

18950,What are vibrations,,,In Sahaja Yoga some things are prohibited‚ that nobody should touch anybody's feet and no Sahaja Yogi should allow anyone to touch his or her feet. This is one of the great Bandhans for all Sahaja Yogis. No one should touch other's Feet and nobody should ask to touch his or her feet‚ whatever may be your quality. Those who will touch will lose vibrations‚ and those who will get salutations will also catch on the heart. So‚ such conditions‚ which we have about Sahaja Yoga also‚ should be removed.,https://www.amruta.org/p/4656,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18960,What are vibrations,,,The basis of all creativity of Saraswati is love. If there is no love there is no creativity.,https://www.amruta.org/p/3786,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18970,What are vibrations,,,So‚ all the activity on right hand side‚ of Saraswati‚ basically has to end up in love. Starts with love and ends up in love. Whichever does not end up in love‚ coils up and finishes off. It just disappears. So you can see that even matter which is not used for love just finishes off. The basis has to be love.,https://www.amruta.org/p/3786,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18980,What are vibrations,,,Now this love of‚ that we talk of‚ the great love of God we talk of‚ we know that it for definite through vibrations. People do not have vibrations‚ but still they can feel the vibrations in a very unconscious way. All the great paintings of the world have vibrations. All the great creative works of the world have vibrations. Only those who have vibrations have been sus- tained by time – otherwise all other things are destroyed. There must have been monuments and horrible statues and horrible things that have been created long time back. But they are all destroyed by Nature as they could not stand the impact of the KALA () – that is the destructive power of time. So‚ all that is sustaining‚ all that is nurturing‚ all that is enabling comes from this sense of love‚ which is within us very much developed‚ but within others also‚ who are not yet realised. Ultimately the whole world has to realise that one has to go to that ultimate love of God‚ oth- erwise it has no meaning.,https://www.amruta.org/p/3786,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18990,What are vibrations,,,"Supposing you ask a question‚ 'Is there God?' you get vibrations tremendous. If you ask a question: 'Am I the spirit?' you get lots of vibrations coming in. Then you get a madman‚ and put your hands towards the per- son‚ you start burning your hands. He's definitely approved‚ certified mad person. So then it is proved that what the vibrations are telling‚ is the truth.""",https://www.amruta.org/p/2087,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19000,What are vibrations,,,I would say one more thing‚ we must have study groups in Sahaja Yoga‚ very important. I find many people are there‚ quite a big percentage‚ who do not know much about Sahaj Yoga. They are enjoying themselves‚ they have got vibrations‚ they have got this – but they don't know much about it.,https://www.amruta.org/p/2087,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19010,What are vibrations,,,Try to understand Sahaj Yoga. And some people understand it very well. Some people – mentally‚ you must understand Sahaj Yog first of all. Then we have other books on Sahaj Yog which you must read‚ which are simpler books. Then you can ask questions to deal – you must have a study group.,https://www.amruta.org/p/2087,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19020,What are vibrations,,,Now electromagnetic vibrations are the Right sided vibrations are‚ of the dead‚ we shall say. Now our vibrations are what we are calling this Chaitanya‚ is the combination of all these three plus the Artha Maatra‚,https://www.amruta.org/p/2087,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19030,What are vibrations,,,"[ed. translation: ""being only the matter itself""] is the Adi Shakti on top of that. So we have four types of vibrations integrated in these vibra- tions: emotional side‚ evolutionary and the one that is electromagnetic. So we have all these vibrations within us integrated‚ and on top of that is the fourth one which is the Adi Shakti's vibrations. They organise‚ they think‚ they work out‚ they direct‚ they choose‚ they do everything which is the administrative side. So we have four types of vibrations within.
Now see a camera. I'll tell you an example. I went to a station for my own photographs. So there were four photographs every time I come. The first one didn't have so much depth‚ second one improved‚ the third one improved‚ and the fourth one was the best. What happened that when the first photograph came in‚ it received some vibrations‚ I think‚ and it changed electromagnetic into the Chaitanya‚ little bit. And the fourth one was good. Like you people‚ when you take my photograph‚ I'm very much different from the photographs taken by people who are not Sa- haj Yogis. Sometimes I look in those photographs‚ otherwise‚ as if I am standing with somebody with a pistol at my back. [laughter] But the cam- era‚ which is not touched by anyone‚ which is facing me all the time‚ re- cords so many things which normally people cannot. Now you know that the people who were taking very good photographs have suddenly lost that power‚ because their ego has come up. They have started thinking they were very great photographers‚ this‚ that and thinking no end of themselves. So their photographs are not showing such results. The other day‚ I saw a photograph of Mine and I told the person who has taken the photograph and he was amazed. How did I know? I said: ""I can see all the chakras represented in this photograph."" From the photograph‚ I can make out who has taken the photograph.
So when a person is dealing with these electromagnetic vibrations say‚ for example: here are electromagnetic vibrations‚ isn't it? [Mother touch- es the microphone] Simple as that‚ here‚ on this. Now they receive my vibrations‚ and whatever I talk becomes a mantra. When I blow in this‚ I blow in your Sahastrara.
Electromagnetic is a wee bit of a dimension‚ one third of the Right side – one third of the Right side electromagnetic – out of which this Universe is created. Then‚ there are other vibrations which are beyond elec- tromagnetic. Like‚ we have five elements. Electromagnetic are only two elements‚ two elements which are combined together; it's very easy to combine two elements: no permutations and combinations. But when there are five elements‚ these three combinations can make so many va- rieties and they are alRight sided. So you can imagine there are so many vibrations on the Right side.
We are using the ether for example‚ ether we use for broadcasting. We think it's only electromagnetic is a wrong idea. Now when I speak‚ say‚ and broadcasting it goes in the ether‚ it's the Adi Shakti. So it governs it. Then it manages things. It can work on your Sahastrara. It can work on so many Kundalinis. It can work on the nature. But they are so frightened of me they never allow me to go on the TV. The negative.
So electromagnetic are just a wee part of it as I told you‚ it's just the com- bination of the Mother Earth and electricity. That is we can say‚ comes out of the water element. That's all.
Electromagnetic things have helped in one way in creating life. Because where there were only gases created – helium‚ hydrogen‚ oxygen – it was the electrical charge‚ which changed them into life. Amino-acids where formed like that. But the electrical charge also changed them because there was Adi Shakti's power working on them. The administration was done by Adi Shakti's power. So it's just a wee bit of it.
And if you have to achieve anything on the electromagnetic you can show wonders out of it‚ wonders! Vibrations can pass onto it – means that it ad- ministers those vibrations which are – sound vibrations‚ now for example take it as sound vibrations – are carried by electromagnetic vibrations. In the same way‚ Chaitanya can be carried on electromagnetic vibrations. They can be carriers‚ but Chaitanya cannot carry electromagnetic.",https://www.amruta.org/p/2087,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19040,What are vibrations,,,"So‚ even on the Right side the vibrations we get in the molecules‚ as you know that we get molecules like sulfur dioxide‚ if you have the sulfur has two oxygen and the oxygen goes on pulsating like that.
They are asymmetric‚ symmetric type of vibrations‚ you all must be knowing about it. So‚ all these things‚ symmetric and asymmetric vibrations are created by whom? Nobody wants to know. Nobody wants to find out‚ because after all in an atom or a – imagine‚ in a molecule that deep‚ who does that job?
Is done by Shri Hanumana in His subtle ways. So‚ He has another great siddhi‚ which we call as anima. Anima‚ anu‚ anu means a molecule‚ and that means it can enter into a molecule or renu is the atom – it can enter into molecule or into atom. Now‚ many scientists think that in the modern times they discovered the molecules. It's not so‚ because it's already in our oldest scriptures description of anima is there‚ is of anu‚ renu is there. So‚ is already described there.
Now then‚ wherever you see the electromagnetic forces working it is worked through Hanumana's blessings. He's the one who creates electromagnetic forces. So now‚ we can see that as Ganesha has got the magnetic force in Him‚ He's the magnet‚ He has got the magnetic force‚ then we can say the electro-magnetic is the one which we call as Hanumana's force‚ on the material side of it.
But from the matter He goes up to the brain. So‚ He rises from Swadhishthana up to the brain so‚ in the brain also He creates the co-re- lationships of the different sides of our brain. So how much He gives us‚ I mean‚ we can say if Ganesha gives us the wisdom‚ then He gives us the power to think. He protects us also that we should not think of bad things. That is we can say that‚ that if Ganesha gives us the wisdom‚ then Shri Hanumana gives us the conscience.",https://www.amruta.org/p/1807,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hanumana,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Qualities,,
19050,What are vibrations,,,"As you know that vibrations have light. It's very light flickering‚ very small light‚ each particle of vibration has and you can see that. But when there are too many‚ then they can be caught up by your cameras. But yesterday I think the clouds got vibrated. And is a very great thing to get the clouds vibrated. If the clouds are vibrated‚ the rain will be vibrated. If the rain is vibrated‚ the land will be vibrated. All the crops that are to be germinated will be vibrated too‚ so when it goes into the body of human beings‚ they'll get also vibrations. Is the best way now is to vibrate the clouds‚ I think‚ if you have to have many more people for Sahaja Yoga.
That's the idea came into My mind last night that why not vibrate all the clouds‚ that's the best way. Moreover the vibrations are very tiny bit‚ with one point going into a half circle normally. This half circle then com- bines to make ""Aum"" sometimes‚ sometimes it makes a chain‚ sometimes it gathers together to make crosses. But the basic thing about them is that they can think‚ and think very fast‚ much faster than human be- ings can think. And they are extremely collective‚ extremely collective. So they move together‚ thinking the same way‚ understanding the same way in an absolute manner and work out the whole thing in a very beau- tiful silent way that you cannot even feel.",https://www.amruta.org/p/6988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The whole of the discretion of the cosmos is with us. The vibrations that think are there. The vibrations that guide are with us. The vibrations that organize are with us. Let them organize us. We are playing into their hands by which we are not bound‚ but we are helped. Like supposing you have a baby‚ you have to look after the baby. But if there's somebody‚ she says‚ ""All right‚ let me look after your baby."" She says‚ ""All right."" Then you go to sleep. There's somebody who says‚ ""All right‚ don't you worry‚ I'll make a nice bed for you."" So he says‚ ""All right."" So they make a nice bed for him. Then you sleep there‚ there's somebody to cover you‚ nicely you are covered. Then they say‚ ""All right‚ you have to now go for your bath -see the bath's ready for you‚ come along have your bath."" Then you want to have your puja -""All right‚ there's a nice place for you‚ come along have this."" You want to have an ashram? ""All right‚ there's a nice place for you available‚ have it."" So it is not that you are bound by them. This is the point I am trying to make. But you are invited‚ you are treated with great respect and regard and everybody at your service. You say‚ ""Mother‚ You come in my head""‚ I'll come in your head. You say‚ ""Come in my heart""‚ I'll come in your heart. You say‚ ""Come in my hands""‚ I'll come in your hands.

19070,What are vibrations,,,"With a very open mind‚ we have to see to it‚ that truth is beyond human awareness. Unless and until you rise to a level of a realized soul‚ you can- not feel the truth. That means you have to have your rebirth. But it is not just a false certificate that you are being born again. It is the actual- ization. It is not like‚ somebody saying‚ ""All right‚ I baptize you here and you have finished with it"". But it is actually feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your head. Unless and until you have become the Spirit you cannot get connected to the Divine. It is said that we are surrounded by the All Pervading Power of God's Love. But have you feel it? As described in many various Scriptures that it‚ you can feel it like a cool breeze‚ did you feel that way? You cannot pay for getting to truth. You cannot purchase it. Because it is a living process of evolution‚ of a living force that has to do this. And any living force you cannot purchase.
Like in the Mother Earth you put a seed and it sprouts by itself You can- not force Mother Earth to do that. And you cannot pay Mother Earth for that. It has to happen spontaneously by the power of the Mother Earth. If the seed is all right‚ then it will sprout and it will be transformed into a plant. In the same way we are transferred and transformed into a new awareness. This awareness is called as the collective consciousness. That is‚ you can feel your inner being on your fingertips. You can feel another person also on your fingertips.
Mohammed Sahib has said in Quran that there will be a time of Kiama‚ means the Resurrection‚ when your hands will speak and give witness against you‚ In the Bible we know of the Last Judgment. God is not going to judge us by putting us in the weight‚ measurements. You are going to judge yourself. So  ... Did you talk about Kundalini? So the force that is within you called Kundalini‚ rises through the various centers within you which are subtler. You become sensitive on your fingertips.

Not only that but your attention be- comes so powerful‚ that sitting down here‚ you can feel the chakras of other people. Because you enter into a new realm of awareness‚ where you start feeling the All Pervading Power. This All Pervading Power Itself is the subtle of all the elements. It is the subtle of the ether.

19090,What are vibrations,,,"The first thing‚ in Sahaja Yoga‚ is that you get the experience‚ experience of feeling the spanda‚ the cool breeze‚ on your finger tips. Without the ex- perience you should not believe anything. That means a new dimension has come now‚ in your nerves‚ that you can feel the system which has been not known to you. Sympathetic nervous system was there but you never knew how it is working. The knowledge about yourself was so poor. But after Realisation suddenly the whole thing got enlightened. Sudden- ly you started feeling it‚ the newness‚ among yourselves Still sometimes you have to fight your ego‚ you have to get over your ignorance of things. Because Realisation gives you Absolute Knowledge‚ Absolute Knowledge. It cannot be challenged. It's single: as they call it – 'Ekameva Satya'‚ (the only Truth). And when you get that knowledge then you can tally it also. You can find out if it is correct or not.
This is something that has happened to all of you‚ and you have already got those vibrations with which you can feel it. For example‚ there may be some dissatisfied souls with Sahaja Yoga. But you can find out‚ on vibra- tions‚ who are these people and what are they doing. On vibrations you can make out if those people have reached that state of Reality or not. You can make out if these people‚ who are trying to oppose you‚ or trying to tell you something else – ""How far are they?"" On your fingertips you know. This is what is Qiyamah about which Mohammed Saheb has said.",https://www.amruta.org/p/326,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19100,What are vibrations,,,For example you create some painting. You just create it and just look at it without any thought. The complete joy of your heart which you have poured onto that canvas will be filling you completely and you'll feel the flow of joy going down. If creation is done in thoughtless awareness‚ then it's the most pure. Apart from that‚ it is the most beautiful‚ it is the most perfect‚ because such a painting or such an art or such a creation‚ such a thought‚ such a book‚ such an idea‚ will emit vibrations. The co-efficience to emit vibrations will be complete if it is done in thoughtless awareness. That's why those who are realised souls‚ when they create something‚ or they produce something‚ you find it easy to find out whether it is giving vibrations or not‚ very easy.,https://www.amruta.org/p/1201,,Nirvichara Samadhi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19110,What are vibrations,,,Hamsa Chakra is a part of Vishuddhi Chakra on which I've spoken very little and which I would like to speak also later on‚ on a very‚ very bigger scale one day. Is the Abstract‚ the Inner Current of all this Universe that is created‚ it's Pranava itself which is so pure‚ complete purity within yourself‚ absolute purity. Nothing but vibrations. That is only possible through developing your vibratory awareness and your discrimination. Nothing but vibrations – your vibratory awareness is the only way you see‚ smell‚ feel‚ everything through vibratory awareness.,https://www.amruta.org/p/1201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19120,What are vibrations,,,"I have seen people behaving funnily in that also‚ like in everything they'll say‚ ""Let me see the vibration of this‚ let me see the vibration; let me see the vibration of that."" Then they'll say‚ ""Your vibrations are not all right. His vibrations are not right."" This is not the way to make fun of vibra- tions. A state must come when you don't have to see vibration‚ just feel it!",https://www.amruta.org/p/1201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19130,Vibrations and Realization,,,You must know that the whole society is in a whirlwind‚ it's a whirlwind‚ so somebody has to steady oneself and stop and try to change the winds. And that's why a Sahaja Yogi has to stand up and understand that respect and reverence of parents is important. But it is an actual thing‚ because if you are not good with your mother your Left side is weak; you have seen it on the vibrations. Whatever I say you can see it on your vibrations. You will be the loser‚ so forgive her. Know that she has given you birth. Maybe if she has been harsh to you‚ angry with you or done something – forgive her. And you will be amazed‚ you can win her over‚ it's not diffi- cult because by your goodness to her‚ by your over-goodness towards her‚ relatively‚ it will work.,https://www.amruta.org/p/10136,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19140,Vibrations and Realization,,,All these things are there so we have to stop it and change it. This is the point. Sahaja Yogis must know that we have to change and transform ourselves and that is the point [where] they feel bad. We are not only responsible for our change but we have to bring about the change in the whole world‚ where the society is getting destroyed‚ the human beings are getting destroyed‚ so we have to stand up. So we have to change our way of thinking.,https://www.amruta.org/p/10136,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19150,Vibrations and Realization,,,Vibrations‚ as I said‚ that is the manifestation of the Spirit. But it is a very vague way of expressing it. Now see‚ if there's a nice flame before me‚ this candle has been enlightened. Now what does it do? It gives you light. Alright‚ but how does it give you light? By throwing light towards you‚ by emitting light. It is the emitting‚ of pulsation from the Self. This light‚ this is light. Actually there is sound‚ there is light; very high frequency sound – very high frequency. Actually many types of sounds are mixed in. There's is magnetism in this‚ in these vibrations. It has all the five elements -the subtle of all the five elements (tanmatras) inside these vi- brations only. They are talking‚ they are telling you‚ they are guiding you‚ they are helping you. It's because the Spirit is working through them. Like this light that you take in your hand: you go in the darkness‚ and you see that there is an impediment in between [and] you have to cross it. So you get the idea with this light. The light is doing that for you. So‚ when the Spirit pulsates in your conscious mind‚ in your conscious mind‚ then it is a Self-realised personality. But in the unconscious it is there‚ all the time working. Actually the Spirit Itself comes out. It's as big as your thumb is. But you can contain your thumb in your heart. That is the reflection of the God Almighty within us‚ because heart receives that image within itself‚ it is pulsating and is emitting the Knowledge through our unconscious. Spirit is an unconscious being till we are real- ised. Once we are realised it becomes conscious‚ it starts emitting itself and pulsating. And what is Spirit? Is God Almighty Himself‚ in a min- iature form‚ which is reflected within us. The more we clean our heart‚ which represents all the seven chakras within us. There are seven auras around our heart. All the seven chakras which are here in the Sahastrara‚ the seats are there‚ and all the seven chakras that are there‚ within us‚ have seven auras around our heart and when all of them are clear-cut‚ absolutely clear‚ pure‚ integrated then the complete emission starts‚ of those vibrations.,https://www.amruta.org/p/10136,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19160,Vibrations and Realization,,,"So the vibrations are actually the things which are the doers and the en- joyers. They are the one‚ who enjoy‚ also‚ if they find a very good Self-re- alised soul coming. Then you just feel the Self-realised soul and you say‚ ""Oh very good. Come along‚ come along. Just have it"" Everybody starts enjoying that joy that's coming from that person. And that is what it is‚ that you start enjoying that beauty in that person through the vibrations.",https://www.amruta.org/p/10136,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19170,Vibrations and Realization,,,"But these vibrations only‚ which connect you with the All-pervading Power‚ which are part of the All-pervading power‚ these pervading Al- mighty's eyes‚ you can say – they are the ones who look after each and every minute thing in this whole world. Can you think of such a multi-di- mensional thing? Now you have seen how vibrations work on people‚ how they dissolve even the thick bones and how they bring out the Kundalini here and how you see the softness on your head. Just you cannot explain how‚ because they only do everything. They have the universal communi- cation centres and they have universal broadcasting stations‚ they have universal TV centres there. Everything is there. In short‚ you just copy them a little bit and you think you are doing something but you really don't do anything whatsoever. That's why it is said that Brahma – this is the expression of Brahma‚ these vibrations are the Brahma – is the only Truth‚ the rest is all avidya‚ is all a maya‚ is just an illusion. We live in illu- sions you see. He is the Enjoyer‚ He is the Doer‚ you are just in between to see Him. It would be like this mic (microphone) thinking that he's giving the lecture of Sahaja Yoga – it's really like that!!
So to explain what is vibrations may not be so simple in all its details. But the overall idea I have given to you.",https://www.amruta.org/p/10136,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19180,Vibrations and Realization,,,For a Sahaja Yogi‚ there is the power given‚ of loving himself‚ that he corrects himself‚ in True Love. I don't know how much‚ really‚ we know how much we have to love ourselves. If you truly love yourself‚ truly love yourself‚ then you would like to do something of which you are really proud‚ within your heart. Say‚ giving realisation to someone‚ is such a joy-giving thing within yourselves. You feel so happy about it. You may do hundreds of things in this world but you won't feel that way as you would feel when you have given realisation to someone. Because it's a liv- ing process which you can do. But when you really understand yourself‚ the need of your Self‚ then you really love yourself very well. Otherwise you really do not know what to do to love yourself. To love yourself means – you must know that this body of yours is a special body‚ now‚ because it is emitting vibrations‚ it's a temple of God so respect it. Respect your body. Don't be vulgar about your body.,https://www.amruta.org/p/10136,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19190,Vibrations and Realization,,,"You have to be a little particular about it because I have seen people‚ when they shake their hands‚ they do receive more bad vibrations than [they] give good vibrations to others. Shaking hands or hugging others‚ or bringing your body to them only‚ the vibrations‚ one has to be very careful as to [see that] you do not spoil.
Then this body is nurtured on food: so food also‚ is important that a food that is cooked by a person who is loving‚ good‚ nice‚ is good for this body. But if you eat a food cooked by a person who is‚ say‚ a murderer‚ immediately your body will revolt‚ your stomach will revolt against it and that's why‚ to keep your stomach alright‚ try to avoid such places which give you bad vibrations. Your digestion will be very bad if you go to places which are not good.",https://www.amruta.org/p/10136,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19200,Vibrations and Realization,,,As animals are not sensitive to many filths that we have around‚ but we are‚ in the same way you start getting sensitive to the filth‚ the inner filth‚ that subtler filth which we do not see‚ so you avoid it. Try to avoid it and you will feel much better. And you will yourself feel your priorities will change‚ your friends will change‚ your everything will change and automatically you will not like many things that people are talking about and just your interest will go away.,https://www.amruta.org/p/10136,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19210,Vibrations and Realization,,,Your tastes change‚ your styles change. But allow it to grow and manifest itself and accept it. Gradually it will work out. If you press on it‚ say you are used to the smoking‚ you will give up smoking‚ you will not like it. First you will feel like vomiting about it and all that.,https://www.amruta.org/p/10136,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19220,Vibrations and Realization,,,"You see‚ Spiritual health is the health you get from love‚ the food of love. It's different from food of so-called wrestlers bodies‚ the kind of thing the wrestlers eat. Food of love‚ we have to take it with love and give it with love and made with love‚ that is the food is of the highest of all.
So‚ that's the body part of it‚ we can see how to look after the body is to not to think too much about food and spontaneously‚ if somebody gives you something with love‚ you just take it. That's how you should eat. But if anybody gives you with hatred don't take that food. It's better not to eat such a food than to eat a poisonous thing. It's poisonous for Sahaja Yogis.",https://www.amruta.org/p/10136,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sit down with him for day and night and fight it out with him and see to it. You just say that‚ ""I'm going on a fast because you have taken to drinking."" Work it out! Put all the pressures that are possible under your command. Tell all the Sahaja Yogis‚ all of you work it out.
You know‚ I was very happy sometimes people told me‚ ""Mother‚ will you please put attention to such-and-such‚"" all of you put together‚ if they say‚ then I say‚ ""They are on right stages."" ""We are all fasting for such and such person‚"" ""We are doing this for such and such people. We are working on such and such person."" And go and fight with that person‚ tell him on his face and do it. That something is great.

You are saints and you have to behave like saints towards each other‚ you have to respect because you are saints and that God is in you now emitting It's light as vibrations.

19250,Vibrations and Realization,,,Sometimes‚ even if you lose vibrations‚ doesn't matter. You are a realised soul and you will be a realised soul. Even if you are reborn you will be a re- alised soul no doubt about it. You are not going to lose it. And if anybody says anything to you [it] doesn't matter‚ makes no difference‚ because you are a realised soul‚ you are above it‚ so let them say whatever they like.

19260,Vibrations and Realization,,,"Yogi: Some Sahaja Yogis have been getting colds. Now‚ if they are getting vibrations‚ should they be getting colds? And if they are getting colds‚ are they doing wrong things or eating wrong things?

Shri Mataji: That is the 'blessing' of this country (laughter) that you get cold. I mean‚ this is also a human nature‚ you see. Just see the beauty of it. You see‚ in India‚ now‚ for example‚ my husband‚ at least‚ wears seven sweaters‚ you won't believe it. See now‚ he's (a yogi in the room) wear- ing a sweater which is covering his neck. Those who come from the hot country keep themselves much more protected than you people. I have always requested all of you to buy one scarf each of a very thick thing‚ that you should always keep your neck covered with a scarf. So‚ I have been requesting everybody that you bring it‚ I'll vibrate it‚ I'll give it to you‚ do that. And also you should know what it causes because of hot and cold you see. Never take anything cold after hot. Gradually you start from cold to the hot.
Now‚ the another thing which catches Vishuddhi to begin with‚ is when you do not have consideration of the collectivity‚ in a subtler way. In a subtler way it starts like that. When you are aware of the collective being then the Vishuddhi is much better. Because of the ego problem here‚ also‚ the Vishuddhi catches because once the ego is there you are move indi- vidualistic‚ ""I am this‚ I am that‚"" so it goes hand in hand with that. So one has to be more careful that we should keep our neck covered and use also some balm or something‚ just to give it some soothing thing. But‚ what is the best thing for your throats‚ is salt. You see‚ at this point you become the Viraat‚ the All-pervading‚ you can say‚ the Primordial Being. Now‚ pervading into everything is done through salt. Salt dissolves into all the solvent things. So salt is the thing‚ solution‚ for this. From the ocean you take out the salt which is clear cut and then you put it here. This is‚ also‚ is Viraata's thing.",https://www.amruta.org/p/10136,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19270,Vibrations and Realization,,,"Yogi: Shri Mataji is it easier for evil spirits of bhoots to get into Sahaja Yogis?
Shri Mataji: No‚ it is more difficult but you can feel them. You see the thing is‚ when you are not a Sahaja Yogi you cannot feel it. You can get possessed‚ you can get depressed‚ you can get all kinds of things‚ you might even become a lunatic person‚ you may. Whatever may happen but you won't feel it. But as soon as you are a Sahaja Yogi you can feel it and that's how you can guard yourselves. It is very difficult. And if you know all the methods of guarding then it's even better. And actually Sahaja Yo- gis do not catch‚ as I said‚ but if you go on feeling‚ ""I have caught‚ I have caught‚"" so you have it!
Yogi: As far as I can really see that before one can really get in control of one's body from the start one is especially vulnerable (to bhoots). is that so?
Shri Mataji: No‚ no. You are much less vulnerable. But only you can feel it because you are sensitive. Like‚ if you have a pain‚ they may kill it with some sort of a numb effect. But when it goes out you feel it. In the same way‚ you are numbed before realisation‚ and after realisation you aren't. And that's what Sahaja Yogis think that‚ they all attack us and all that. They are literally frightened of you because you are much more powerful. It's an idea that‚ ""We are attacked because we are Sahaja Yogis."" (laugh- ing) The idea is that. Nothing of the kind. On the contrary they run away‚ they run away.",https://www.amruta.org/p/10136,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The experience has to be there‚ and the experience of Realization is described very clearly in some of the scrip- tures and which says that you have to feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. In the Sanskrit language‚ Adi Shankaracharya has described as Salilam Salilam meaning cool breeze‚ cool breeze. Now this cool breeze is not chilling breeze nor is this a hot breeze but a kind of a cool soothing effects that you feel all around yourself which you have never felt before. You have never felt the existence of this all-pervading Power. But it is there‚ and one has to seriously think about it. It's nothing frivolous as I was also born in a Christian family so Sunday morning get ready‚ go to Church and meet few people‚ ""Hello‚ hello‚"" come back after the sermon‚ it's not like that. It's also not like going to a temple just pay a few rupees here‚ there and give something to the Deities and come back home.

How has this Universe been made? Why was it made? Is Param-Atma existing? These doubts are basic. Even Gods have not understood them. But what I have told‚ if it's right or wrong‚ can be ascertained on vibrations. For that‚ your vibrations should be good. When you will learn with your experience's that love and Truth are one. And when‚ with your experienc- es‚ you will realise your very subtle Brahma Tattwa‚ then your illusion‚ that Brahma is detached‚ will go.

19350,Vibrations and Realization,,,"So we have to judge now on vibrations and not on our understanding or what we think or what we understand through this brain. By asking ques- tions and by talking too much about it‚ you cannot understand Sahaja Yoga. For Sahaja Yoga you have to have that super state of mind‚ where you can receive vibrations‚ can feel vibrations and have to be absolutely compromised on them. If there is still the tag of that ego so much that you still question Sahaja Yoga and think no end of yourself‚ it is better that such a person should not attend the pujas‚ not attend the pujas. It is kind to himself.
It is being nice to himself that such a person who has doubts should not attend a puja‚ because puja is only meant for people who have achieved‚ received that state of mind which is called as Nirvikalpa‚ where there is no vikalpa‚ where there is no doubt in your mind. If there are still doubts in your mind‚ your mind is still very powerful‚ and it is going to put you down. So either before puja you tell your mind to keep quiet. Tell him not to talk now‚ ""Better keep quiet‚ now I have to ascend and I have to receive the blessings of the Divine.

19360,Vibrations and Realization,,,"After realisation the truth that comes to you is the real pure truth and is not your ego.
For example now we are in this hall I have been here before or not‚ wheth- er I was in this place or not? How will you know? It's not possible. But for a realised soul it is very easy to make out because they can feel the vibrations of the place. They can make out that somebody here has been a person who had self-realisation and now in this hall there are so much vibrations that even to speak to you I have to watch it's just right‚ if those who can feel it can feel it but those who cannot feel it‚ for them is just the same‚ no difference at all. So when the truth is felt within us‚ our intelligence tells us is the same thing. If you are inert‚ people say like this stone‚ or this thing‚ it might suck in the vibrations‚ it may have the vibrations and now see the point‚ the differences‚ but it will not be in- telligent‚ or it is not intelligible to that particular matter. So the matter when it is inert is not sensitive to understand‚ it is different to absorb vi- brations‚ but it is very difficult unless and until you are a human being to discern it‚ to find out whether there are vibrations or not. Like we would say that‚ I went once to Kashmir‚ with my husband and we were going out somewhere in the wilderness and suddenly I felt tremendous vibrations in that place. So I told the driver there must be something great here‚ is there a temple or is there a mosque? He said nothing this all wilderness. I said lets go the way we get the vibrations‚ so I asked him you drive on this side‚ and we came on a road you see‚ crossing through something‚ we came on a road‚ and on that road and we found there were some poor people living and some other people just walking about. So I asked them have you got any temple here? They said no‚ we have nothing‚ but we have further‚ if you go‚ there's a mosque. What is that mosque? It's called as Hazarat Bhal means one hair of Mohammed Sahib is kept in that place. I said really‚ just imagine! One hair of Mohammed Sahib was kept in that place and I caught it up at least five miles away. So that you can imagine that hair may not be aware of the vibrations it has‚ but the one who is a human being and a realised soul gets the awareness five miles away from that hair‚ that there lies the hair of Mohammed Sahib.
Now for this hair there has been big quarrel and fight and this and that and then it was replaced‚ all sorts of things‚ but ones who were fighting even for that do not know what it is. Just fighting for nothing at all. Like that you can see that those things which have got‚ we can say matter in it‚ same matter becomes a human being after sometime through evolution- ary process and the same thing which was just a matter when it becomes a human being‚ becomes aware of those divine vibrations. Before that it can not‚ so we cancel out all the animals. I had a dog which used to vi- brate‚ if anybody came used to say Mother what vibrations coming from this dog. And it used to feel if some man with nasty feelings or something would come in the house‚ he knew it was‚ so it used to bark on that. He knew many things but he was not aware that he had vibrations‚ he could not feel himself that he had vibrations. He kept a very good health and was a pedigree dog but the doctor said that this dog is remarkable for his own pedigree‚ he's too tall and too broad and very healthy you see‚ but because of the vibrations he kept up that kind of health.
So one has to understand that you become the truth‚ means your aware- ness itself becomes aware of Divine. That your central nervous system‚ or you can say that your brain evolves to that state that you can feel the vibrations. That's one thing. Then you can not only feel the vibrations but you can discern them‚ you can find out whether these are good vibrations or bad vibrations. Then you can also say whether these vibrations are par- tial or full vibrations from the person‚ if the person has got some sort of a disease or a trouble‚ you can without knowing a word about medicine‚ you can say this person is suffering from such and such diseases.
Imagine the computer that we are‚ we are really the greatest computer that anybody can produce. Human beings can't produce this computer. The one they have produced is just a copy of this which is not such a great copy also‚ because this computer sees something and knows this is this‚ it doesn't think. Can you think of a computer which doesn't think? Just without thinking it knows‚ And that's the computer we are. Now this great computer of our brain which just sees and knows‚ feels and knows‚ smells and knows‚ this special computer becomes a greater‚ we can say subtler instrument which knows the divine‚ which feels the divine‚ which understands the divine and can manoeuvre it‚ it can manoeuvre it.",https://www.amruta.org/p/4718,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19370,Vibrations and Realization,,,And it so happened that in the West people thought that by using their brainpower they can now master the matter; that they can use matter for their own purpose. If they had done it after their Self-realization‚ it would have been a very different situation‚ because after Self-realization you all have become aware of vibrations‚ which is chaitanya‚ and also of your chakras. With this new awareness‚ you would have avoided all that was wrong.,https://www.amruta.org/p/236,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19380,Vibrations and Realization,,,So in the awareness of Sahaja Yogis where you know all about your chakras‚ you know about vibrations‚ you know how you relate to others‚ still all this knowledge is for personal advantages.

19390,Vibrations and Realization,,,"Though now you are aware‚ you are aware and conscious of your chakras‚ you do not keep them clean. Ordinary human beings if they have clothes‚ they have houses‚ they try to keep it clean. But you do not feel ashamed of them also when they are bad‚ because after some time you also lose the awareness of them. That means you have become subtler‚ but in your consciousness you are not yet subtle.
There are so many things you know more than the people who are not realized‚ as absolute reality. For example: We don't even use vibrations. Whenever it is needed‚ we don't use it. Or sometimes mechanically‚ just like a machine‚ we start giving bandhans. So you are still unconscious about your chakras. Slightly conscious when you put your mind to it‚ otherwise‚ in your central nervous system you are not yet so conscious. This is the reason‚ why you do not know why you had to do a thing at a particular time.

19400,Vibrations and Realization,,,When the Kundalini pierces through the fontanelle bone area you start getting the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost from your soft bone here. Then we say you have got Self Realization. But it is not yet established. It has to be established.,https://www.amruta.org/p/394,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19410,Vibrations and Realization,,,"Christ paved the way – the other way round. He said‚ ""Put Chaitanya into your matter""‚ so you'll enjoy that Chaitanya.
Put Chaitanya‚ the vibrations‚ into the matter. This is His message. He didn't get resurrected only like His Spirit going out‚ but the whole His body resurrected Himself. So He's talking about the Resurrection of the body‚ of the matter‚ within us.
In Sahaja Yoga also when we come in‚ Kundalini rises‚ She gives you reali- zation you do feel the Chaitanya in your hands‚ you feel it all around‚ your faces shine like beautiful lotuses‚ your skin improves‚ you look blooming‚ everything is fine‚ but still there are material attachments‚ which may be very subtle‚ could be very gross.
The gross could be like ""This is my carpet‚ this is my car‚ this is my or- nament"" – something like that. But if it comes to the style of Christ‚ you have to get identified with the matter which is vibrated‚ which is vibrating‚ which has got vibrating value – not material value but vibrating val- ue‚ spiritual value‚ divine value. Could be anything – could be flowers‚ could be water‚ could be a sari‚ could be a seat‚ could be anything that becomes valuable‚ so attention starts shifting from gross to vibrations.
But‚ even now if you have the lurking attention into material things‚ then it's difficult for you to rise fast. Everything that you use‚ is it helpful for your vibrations or not?
Everything that you do‚ is it good for your vibrations or not? Or is it the same old fashion you are carrying‚ like the mad people I saw yesterday – they had come for holiday and they didn't know how to enjoy‚ they were trying everything‚ you see. They must have paid lots of money to their tourism‚ poor things‚ they must have paid lots of money in the hotels‚ they must have paid lots of money in the restaurant‚ but I felt they were not enjoying at all‚ none of them were enjoying – they were miserable and they didn't know what to do‚ and at the end of it I was thinking‚ that they might just go and break their heads with frustration.
So matter can never give you joy.
Only the matter that is vibrated‚ that has vibrations‚ can give you joy. A human being can never give you joy. May be your wife‚ may be your chil- dren‚ may be your father‚ mother or anyone‚ unless and until that person is‚ has got vibrations‚ because joy is the blessings of God. And unless and until you have connected with God‚ whatever you may try‚ whatever you may acquire‚ you can never have that joy.",https://www.amruta.org/p/394,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19420,Vibrations and Realization,,,Try to show that beauty in you so that they come to you and see for yourself‚ see for themselves‚ that you are resurrected people‚ you are resurrected. Spirit is always there in your heart‚ always there‚ watching you‚ seeing you‚ but now because the matter that surrounds the Spirit is being resurrected‚ is being vibrated‚ your eyes shine‚ your skin shines‚ your face shines‚ you look so beautiful – that is what is Resurrection.,https://www.amruta.org/p/394,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19430,Vibrations and Realization,,,"Only the Chaitanya makes the matter vibrate‚ and unless and until you are connected with God‚ you cannot vibrate anything. Those great Saints‚ prophets‚ incarnations who came on this earth tried to tell this to all of us‚ that ""get connected with God"".",https://www.amruta.org/p/394,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19440,Vibrations and Realization,,,"So today is the message that we have to resurrect our matter‚ within and without.
So you are raising your Kundalini upward‚ is all right. Also you have to spread it – horizontally – to your hands‚ to your feet‚ to your body‚ to your face‚ to your thought‚ to everything. What is a mantra is nothing but a thought which is vibrated. Any thought that is vibrated is a mantra‚ but the vibrations can only be carried by a particular type of‚ or we can say a particular coefficience is needed.
In dress‚ in thinking‚ in anything that is worldly‚ there is a kind of a coefficience that works out the vibrations. If that coefficience is not there‚ you cannot catch the vibrations and you cannot also give vibrations.
So there are only two divergences‚ one is the left‚ another is the right; there are not too many: very easy to get rid of them. There are only two turns in Italy‚ one is right or left. So in the same way within us if you don't go to the left and you don't go to the right‚ you keep in the center‚ you are vibrated‚ you can vibrate everything‚ but to keep in the center‚ not to go to any extremes.",https://www.amruta.org/p/394,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19450,Vibrations and Realization,,,"Many people don't believe in God because wrong things have been done in the name of God. But there is God and we have just to reach that stage where we can feel His love‚ His all pervading power around us‚ like cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. You get your real baptism and you find as cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood and the bone becomes also soft like a child's bone. Then you start feeling the cool breeze all around yourself as very beautiful cool vibrations. Such a person becomes extremely powerful‚ he becomes pow- erful with his compassion. Wherever his attention goes he cures that problem and such a person has a personality or a temperament that when he is among the people who are disturbed and troubled‚ their problems disappear.
The attention itself becomes collectively conscious‚ means you can feel another person on your fingertips‚ the centers. You can feel it within yourself‚ also what is wrong with you on your fingertips. This is what has to happen to all of us when we become really peaceful within and when we are peaceful‚ the peace spreads everywhere.",https://www.amruta.org/p/7028,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19460,Vibrations and Realization,,,"We have to understand what happens when the Sahasrara opens.
When the Kundalini passes through the five centres it enters into the area which we call as limbic area. This area is all surrounded by thousand nerves and when these nerves get enlightened they look like flames of VIBGYOR colours‚ seven colours‚ and very mildly‚ beautifully shining‚ emitting peace.
But when the Kundalini starts emitting its vibration on the sides all these nerves get enlightened gradually and start moving on all directions‚ opening the Sahastrara and then the Kundalini emerges out through the fontanelle bone area‚ which we call as 'Brahmarandhra'. 'Randhra' means the 'hole' and the 'Brahma' is the All-Pervading Power of God's love.
So it enters into the subtle energy‚ which is all-pervading‚ which we do not feel normally. But then the chaitanya‚ the vibrations‚ which are the part and parcel of this energy‚ All-Pervading Power‚ the Paramchaitanya‚ they start entering into our brain and showering their blessings in the limbic area they assemble. Now the limbic area is connected to all the area of the brain and also to the nerves. So it starts flowing onto the nerves giving you the new aware- ness of collective consciousness‚ called as 'samuhik chetana'.
So‚ you get a new chetana‚ a new awareness‚ which is showered upon your limbic area. The working of these chaitanya waves is very interesting. They are normally formed like small commas‚ but then they go into dif- ferent forms. They make themselves into swastikas as the four-limbed symbol of innocence or they become the Omkara: as you know how 'Om' is written‚ which is the symbol of our doing‚ our awareness.
So‚ when they form the swastika they try to nourish the Left side and when they form the Omkara they nourish the Right side: left and right sympathetic nervous systems they nourish.
But Sahastrara to be kept open‚ is rather difficult for people because it's a vicious circle. First‚ these vibrations should enter into your brain through the Brahmarandhra when it is opened out and they should nourish your nerves by which your left and Right side open out and so more chaitanya can flow down all these centres. But if your Sahastrara is not properly opened this process doesn't take place. As a result of that the chakras don't open‚ the Kundalini only as very few strands is kept in the spinal cord and the new strands cannot rise because your chakras are not open. So‚ in Sahaja Yoga‚ it is very important to keep your Sahastrara open.",https://www.amruta.org/p/192,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19470,Vibrations and Realization,,,"But‚ unless and until‚ it is recognised in the heart it's no recognition. Already the heart is surrounded by seven auras of the seven chakras and the Spirit‚ the Atma‚ resides in the heart. As it is‚ on top of your head here‚ resides the God Almighty‚ Sadashiva.
So‚ when Kundalini touches that point your Spirit gets awakened and the light of the Spirit starts spreading and it starts acting on your central nervous system because automatically the vibrations‚ the chaitanya flow into your brain‚ who enlightens your nerves.",https://www.amruta.org/p/192,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You should not have any ego‚ first; you should not have any of your chakras catching; you should be absolutely clear all the time and there the vibrations should be flowing in both the hands.

19520,Experiencing Vibrations,,,You have seen‚ even when you were not realised‚ that‚ supposing you start developing an art in your hand from your very childhood‚ then you develop the deftness of that particular art‚ because a kind of a myelin sheath grows on the nerves. In the same way‚ when you are realised‚ I would say when you are a newly born person‚ if you start respecting your attention then gradually you develop a deftness for Sahaja Yoga. But so many people‚ when they get realised‚ they hardly come second time. Even if they come second time‚ they do not develop the feeling of vibrations more‚ they still go on being busy with their day-to-day work‚ wasting their attention on things which do not give you the subtler feeling. So the subtleness‚ the deftness of the art of Sahaja does not develop itself.,https://www.amruta.org/p/4537,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19530,Experiencing Vibrations,,,As soon as you get realisation‚ you go back to your own gross awareness and start tallying this subtle with the gross‚ so you start again losing your vibrations.,https://www.amruta.org/p/4537,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19540,Experiencing Vibrations,,,The attention of a Sahaja Yogi should be so subtle that he should feel the vibrations‚ he should think of vibrations‚ he should eat vibration‚ drink vibration and enjoy them.,https://www.amruta.org/p/4537,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19550,Experiencing Vibrations,,,The essence of our enjoyment is the joy and the joy is in feeling the vibra- tions. So wherever you get the joy‚ you should have it.

19560,Experiencing Vibrations,,,"Nothing can be alright‚ unless and until you develop the subtleties of your attention. And‚ they develop‚ by receding your attention from all that is gross. Recede your attention! whenever it goes too much into any thought like that‚ ""Oh‚ Forget it!"" But into vibrations pay full attention. Seeing vibrations‚ you pay full attention; seeing your own vibrations‚ pay full attention. Other things you need not worry‚ they will be all looked after. That is how your attention is subtler in the Kingdom of God. The style is different.",https://www.amruta.org/p/4537,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19570,Experiencing Vibrations,,,"Those who have not felt any vibrations shouldn't talk of Sahaj Yog at all; they have no authority. They have to receive vibrations‚ they have to fully imbibe within them‚ and then they can say‚ ""Yes‚ we have felt.""
This is a very important task Sahaja Yogis have to do in these modern times‚ is to tell aloud that they have found the truth. That part is very weak. In whatever way you like: you can write books‚ you can announce it‚ you can talk to your friends‚ to your relations and everywhere; tell them‚ ""This is the truth now!"" That you have entered into the Kingdom of God; that you are blessed by the grace of God. That you are realised-souls. That you have felt the Divine power which is pervading everywhere‚ and that you can give Realisations to others. This you have to tell others. And know that‚ by your accepting Truth you are not adding anything to the Truth‚ but you are adorning yourself.
One requires courage to enjoy the truth. Sometimes people will laugh at you‚ will mock at you‚ may persecute also; but that should not be any worry to you‚ because your relationship is with the statutes and with the grace of God. When that is your connection‚ you should not worry about other people‚ what they have to say about you. You have to stand up‚ adorn yourself with that Truth and talk to people [so] that people will know that you have found it. With that authenticity with which you speak‚ people will know that you have found it.",https://www.amruta.org/p/145,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19580,Experiencing Vibrations,,,The third thing a guru in Sahaja Yoga has to do is to develop detachment. Gradually you do develop it‚ because you find that‚ unless and until you develop that detachment‚ you are not receiving vibrations in full way. All kinds of detachments have to be developed [which] means your priorities change. Once your attention gets fixed up with your Spirit‚ the catch or the hold on things which are of no importance starts reducing by itself.,https://www.amruta.org/p/145,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19590,Experiencing Vibrations,,,"Attention is to be looked after. That's the most important thing because [the] attention is the one which is going to be enlightened.
So we have to know what morality is. Let people laugh at us. Let them say that‚ ""These are goodie-goodies‚"" or this sort of a thing. We are! We are proud to be. We are not ashamed of being righteous people. This is a very important part of righteousness. Those who do not follow this will lose their vibrations very fast.",https://www.amruta.org/p/145,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19600,Experiencing Vibrations,,,I don't know what was the situation here but‚ in India‚ when we were young‚ we were not allowed to listen to all kinds of music‚ not allowed‚ just not allowed; not to see all kinds of filthy things and filthy documentaries and things‚ not allowed. Anything that is impure‚ giving bad vibrations should not be possessed. And even‚ whatever you have‚ you should think: whom you can give this. So it means you should have possessions to express your generosity. A Sahaja Yogi has to be generous like the sea. A miserly Sahaja Yogi‚ I cannot think of that‚ it is like mixing of darkness with light. Miserliness is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga.,https://www.amruta.org/p/145,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19610,Experiencing Vibrations,,,When you'll have these things of vibrations‚ and then you'll give it to a Sahaja Yogi‚ he will know what it is. Never lack in generosity‚ specially amongst Sahaja Yogis. Gradually you will be amazed how‚ through small things‚ you win over [others]; as if the vibrations flow through those things and work out on those people.,https://www.amruta.org/p/145,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19620,Experiencing Vibrations,,,But you'll be surprised. It is very‚ very temperate. I mean it's not a thing that is freezingly cold. If it is freezingly cold that means Left side – if you get very cold. I mean it can never be. Cool Breeze‚ actually‚ is never very cold‚ it's not freezing. It could be hot with some people‚ could be very cool because of their problems. But if you are a normal person you feel a cooler sensation.,https://www.amruta.org/p/4642,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19630,Experiencing Vibrations,,,"So the whole priority‚ the attention‚ goes to things which have good‚ Divine vibrations. It is not bothered about things which have no good vibrations. Whatever has good vibrations‚ it will go to that. Like a person who is a holy person‚ he touches anything‚ it vibrates. He touches water‚ it vi- brates. Anything you touch‚ anything you feel‚ it vibrates it. For example‚ water‚ if you vibrate it‚ it can be a medicine. River Ganges is nothing but vibrated water! You get vibrations from that. These vibrations are Divine vibrations‚ are the vibrations of the power of love of God.
It is something so much out of the blue‚ that suddenly if you hear about these things‚ it sounds quite odd and fantastic But it is not at all to In- dians‚ they know about all it. This knowledge has not come to us. But in the Bible‚ Christ has said that‚ ""Your hands will speak."" Your hands will speak: that means in your hands you will be feeling it. He said it very clearly. Your hands will speak: that is what should happen to us. That our hands should speak‚ means they should communicate to us what they have to communicate. Because all the centres are represented in our hand. As shown there you can see all the centres are on the left hand side and right hand side‚ you can see very clearly how these centres are denoted on our hand. And once you start feeling them‚ if you know the decoding of it‚ you can immediately say what the other person is suffering from‚ what you are suffering from. And then you have to learn how to correct them‚ those problems of the another person.",https://www.amruta.org/p/7236,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19640,Experiencing Vibrations,,,"Only the matter that has a certain coefficience‚ which gives vibrations‚ is the only thing that gives you joy.
Now we don't know if there is such matter around. For example some- body will say Stonehenge. I mean‚ it looks funny with the druids. Of course they don't know anything‚ I agree. But it is not [funny]‚ because Stonehenge is created by the Mother Earth. It has vibrations. They can't feel anything‚ they are standing there‚ singing songs‚ this‚ that. Some- body must have felt in their forefathers. There are many places where you get vibrations from the Mother Earth‚ so many. It is written in the Bible‚ in the ten commandments‚ only that whatever is created by the Mother Earth or by the sky should not be reproduced by human beings and wor- shipped. But there are many things which have come out of the Mother Earth. But unless and until you have vibrations‚ how will you know? You don't know the truth.
So in the human awareness‚ to know the truth‚ is very relative. You will say that‚ ""How is it that this person is fake and that person is not fake?"" ""This is truth that is not truth?"" There's no way of knowing it. Unless and until you get to the Absolute point‚ how will you know the relative?
So when you get your Realisation‚ you can ask‚ ""Is he a real man?"" If he is‚ you will get vibrations. If he's not‚ then‚ you might even get blisters; vibrations will stop maybe; little bit blisters you might get‚ if he is not a right type of a person. If somebody is obstinate‚ you will get indication. If somebody is suffering from some possession‚ you will get indication. If somebody is mentally mad‚ you will know. It's very‚ very systematic‚ and very scientific. God's laws never fail‚ [are] very attentive‚ and everything that you know through it is absolute and correct. Only thing is you have to learn: you have to train up your mind to understand these different things.",https://www.amruta.org/p/7236,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19650,Experiencing Vibrations,,,The wisdom or the essence of Guru Tattwa is a balance. Like when you maintain a plant‚ if you do not give it water‚ it will die. If you give it too much water‚ it will die. So the wisdom lies in understanding how much water should be given to the plant‚ so that it comes up at its best. Now this wisdom has to be achieved through your vibratory awareness. You are placed under the most fortunate circumstances‚ that you are realised souls before your Guru Tattwa is fully established. You have all the pow- ers that any guru can aspire‚ without having the establishment of Guru Tattwa. Specially you are under the complete blanket of the clouds of your Mother's love.,https://www.amruta.org/p/2066,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the awakening takes place you start feeling the vibrations around you‚ the all-pervading Power which you have never felt before through these fingertips. These fingertips which we neglect‚ we misuse them‚ we use them for wrong things‚ these fingertips‚ themselves‚ get enlightened and you start feeling them. 
        
That's what I said‚ that you have to get your awareness which is enlight- ened. It's the awareness which has to manifest. And‚ that's how you start feeling them on your fingers. This is wrong here‚ that's wrong there – you can see where is the problem. Now‚ all these are related to your centers. These are five‚ six and seven. Seven on the left and seven on the right. So‚ this is about your emotional side and this is about your physical and your rational‚ or you can say mental side.
So‚ you can make out a person‚ how he is‚ by just knowing whether you are getting heat from that person‚ whether you are getting burning from that person‚ whether they are getting numb‚ whether they are becoming heavy.

Because when the en- thusiastic deities start emitting vibrations with your asking because you are saints‚ you see‚ they just‚ they are over-enthusiastic. And they are sitting there‚ busy bodies‚ you know‚ they are sitting quietly waiting for a chance‚ you see‚ to emit vibrations‚ to save you‚ you see‚ they want to just rush.
They emit so much that they lose‚ ""just wait‚ just wait"". They want to save you‚ they want to give you‚ they are so anxious in their exalt‚ you see. I like it‚ to see the way they are anxious. But you don't suck it‚ I have a problem there. Once they have given‚ they don't want to take it back. You don't suck it so it has to go to the atmosphere‚ it has to disappear somewhere. It's directed towards you and you don't take it; so where does it go? It anks into My tissues‚ it pains Me. So‚ sucking should be more. Sucking should be more. And just before the puja you should say: ""Mother‚ make me such that I suck more of the Divine."" Just pray that‚ with sincerity from your heart‚ just say that.

Just with the vibratory awareness you should judge yourself: ""Am I the one who is giving vibrations to others? Am I the one who has stored these vibrations‚ or am I getting ruined?""

Sometimes they feel that they are something of a lower type‚ or something wrong with them: that they don't feel the cool breeze. So‚ one of the greatest worry‚ for all of you‚ should be that there are some people who are not feeling anything in their hands. They have been coming to Sahaja Yoga‚ have been religiously working it out‚ but they haven't been able to achieve the first experience of cool breeze. For this there can be many‚ many reasons‚ not one‚ but there can be many reasons.

Enjoy the birds and talk to the sky and come back tomorrow"" – it works out.
Because you have been always like this. In Sahaja Yoga you don't have to achieve anything. You become. First you become and then mentally you understand Sahaja Yoga.

So please‚ if you give realisation to someone‚ take it easy. It will grow. Don't give 'Advent' to read‚ next moment. We do it! Why? We think we should impress the person that Sahaja Yoga is a great thing and the person must read 'Advent' so he'll come to Sahaja Yoga and we'll establish this man because he will see and will be impressed. If somebody is going to be impressed by these things‚ such a person is of no use for Sahaja Yoga‚ take it from Me.

It's a thing that you have to achieve your- self‚ which you achieve‚ that state‚ automatically. Now this is about the Sahaja Yogis who feel that they do not feel any vibrations. Maybe sometimes it happens also in some places also‚ where the Vishuddhi Chakra is very bad‚ you don't feel any cool breeze. So doesn't matter! As long as you feel peaceful‚ enjoy them!

It may work out. And for people who suffer from superego‚ little bit burning your hand on the candle may help. Just try!
Because the hands are not sensitive. So there is a heat or a cool too much. Either you are a frozen personality or you are a heated personality‚ you are not in the centre. So if you are a frozen personality‚ better melt it a little bit‚ try! I never said this before because half of you would have run away if I had said this! But don't burn it to have blisters I am saying! Just a little bit‚ try to see that‚ if you burn your finger the sensitivity will improve.",https://www.amruta.org/p/6233,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19770,Experiencing Vibrations,,,"I have seen that‚ people who had tremendous stigmas about vegetarian food‚ when they took to‚ say‚ protein food‚ they improved very much in vibrations. They did. Protein food is very important for certain people and for certain people carbohydrates. Liverish people should take to car- bohydrates. It is absolutely a open thing for us to understand. But whatever goes against our awareness‚ because in our own awareness we have to achieve our Spirit‚ we drop out that‚ also‚ very easily. I don't have to say that‚ ""Don't drink! Don't smoke!""

Now how do you obey yourself within yourself? It is through vibratory awareness. Try to obey through your vibratory awareness. Any question you want to ask‚ anything you want to do‚ you must obey it through your vibratory awareness. Now some people are not so sensitive‚ that's true. The reason why they are not sensitive is because they think about it. Now you think with your brain‚ all right? If your brain can be enlightened‚ then you will think as the Divine thinks and your sensitivity will im- prove‚ because sensitivity comes from the central nervous system. Now in the central nervous system if there is any blockage it is actually in the brain because all the centers are represented in the brain.",https://www.amruta.org/p/6858,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It doesn't think it has no alternatives‚ it's just enlightened‚ it has its own quality of enlightenment in the purest sense‚ because thinking makes it impure. Your enlightenment becomes impure by your thinking‚ by giving explanations‚ by giving all these nonsensical alternatives. So one should know with the Divine there is no alternative. In Sanskrit the word is pariyai (Spelling?)‚ there is no pariyai for Divine instrument. There's nothing like that. Supposing you don't want to accept it‚ you'll have problems and then you'll say that‚ ""Mother how did we have problems?""",https://www.amruta.org/p/6858,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19800,Experiencing Vibrations,,,Now I'll also tell you about the swayambhu things that come out of Mother Earth. You see the Mother Earth sends out certain forms above Her being for you people to see that there are vibrations. To work out Her spiritual thing by which She makes the spirituality emit among you‚ by which She guides you‚ by which She creates a nucleus for you to worship and this work She does in a very honest manner.,https://www.amruta.org/p/6858,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19810,Experiencing Vibrations,,,"So in us also whatever becomes‚ Spirit remains‚ the rest drops out. And that is what it is when we call it the Ekadasha which brings forth the transformation. And one has to understand we have to drop out many things.
Some people I've seen they say‚ ""What's wrong? I'm smoking‚ still my vibrations are alright"". Some say‚ ""What's wrong? I'm drinking‚ still my vibrations are alright. I'm going to this guru‚ still my vibrations are there‚ I'm having the same type of licentious life‚ still my vibrations are there."" Now it goes a very long way. The vibrations are still there‚ but suddenly they stop‚ and you find you're out of the bounds. You're thrown out completely. But you do not feel how you are thrown out. Gradually you find‚ with a tangent [angle?] you go out. And so one has to be careful about it. So within us lies a force which is centrifugal and a force that is centripetal. So Ekadasha's force is centrifugal‚ by which you are thrown out. Sahaja Yoga doesn't fall onto anybody's feet‚ doesn't request anyone‚ it doesn't flatter anyone. If you want to be there you have to be positively there. And if you don't want to be there it throws you much faster than what you want. That's the trouble with Sahaja Yoga is and this is the loophole of the Sahaja Yoga which I must tell you as a Mother – that it's very anxious to throw you out.",https://www.amruta.org/p/4700,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19820,Experiencing Vibrations,,,For example‚ you want to find out‚ supposing that whether a particular artista was a realized soul or not‚ now what you have to do is just to put your hands towards the paintings and you start getting cool breeze in your hand from the painting. Now supposing you have a friend‚ and you want to find out how he is‚ you have to just put your hands towards the photograph of your friend and you can find out on your fingertips what's wrong with him. Now if you can understand how to cure those problems‚ sitting down here you can cure it. You take ten small children who are realized souls and tie up their eyes and tell them to feel the vibrations of a particular person. Now all the children supposing they raise one finger‚ is burning this one‚ means that person is suffering from cold in the throat‚ in the center here. All of them will show the same finger‚ there's no difference of opinion‚ because truth is one. Because the Spirit is the Truth‚ that's absoluteness‚ there is no compromise in Truth‚ Truth stands on its legs‚ we cannot organize it‚ and we cannot command it‚ we cannot put it into our conceptions‚ it is what it is.,https://www.amruta.org/p/9002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19830,Experiencing Vibrations,,,"Yogi: Can You talk about discrimination Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: It's an innate quality‚ you can't talk about it. Discrimination is not rational. It's an innate quality but the best thing you have are vibrations by which you should see if the things are alright or not. But you must know as Sahaja Yogis as you will grow you will know immediately what is good and what is bad. It's a state in which you just  ... you become discrete. But for that you must know is to have your responses controlled‚ a steady response. Do anything. You just for example you see something for a minute you just become into thoughtless awareness. Then you will have the power of discretion. Is a power it is not a thing that can discussed or thought‚ is a power.
So one has to develop that state and the best is to at any confrontation anything that you face first you become thoughtlessly aware so you enter into the Kingdom of God and then react. The responses must be made very steady and subtle and one should not suddenly change the attentions just now‚ now [sound of fingers snaping] everybody's attention there  ... Mine is not. I did the job.
Yogi: Once again.
Shri Mataji: Alright? The attention now is with Me‚ suddenly all of you turn. What is there to see? Who is responsible? So those who put their attention there pull your ears [Mother is laughing]. I think everybody should do it [Sahaja Yogis are laughing]. Alright  ... so  ... now  ... what's the other question?
Yogi: How an artist who is a Sahaja Yogi what means to create a piece of art?
Shri Mataji: The piece of art must emit vibrations. If it does not emit that means there is something wrong. And going for something higher subjects like Kundalini‚ like the expression of Kundalini the colours of Kundalini and intrudes another world‚ you have to move into that world like you can see we have so many artists for example you can say Blake. And for a Sahaja Yogi it should be a kind of a beautiful integration of the gross and the abstract or realistic and abstract you can say and little bit of impressionism. That's how you should try to integrate all of them. They express one style‚ Sahaja Yogi has his own style‚ because he knows how to mix them‚ how to integrate. But certain colours like black should be avoided. But the pastel colours if they are mixed with black give it a depth to the pastel colours.
Now‚ your Mothers attention goes to Sahaja Yogis‚ that's my attention is. And it is such a remarkable attention that it is described ""Kataksha‚ Kataksha‚ Nireekshana""‚ means every glance examines and acts so then you have that attention then it's alright to see everything‚ because it so deep and penetrating.",https://www.amruta.org/p/9002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19840,Experiencing Vibrations,,,In Sahaja Yoga‚ specially‚ to feel guilty means all your Left side is caught up.

I said‚ ""Give a bandhan."" Gave a bandhan and immediately it worked out‚ you see. Small‚ small things also you'll be surprised that if it doesn't work out‚ you have to just give a bandhan and it works out. It is important to know that you are Sahaja Yogis‚ you are saints and that you can do lots of things and you shouldn't forget it. You shouldn't forget it that you are Sahaja Yogis.

If you are off the balance‚ then you don't even feel vibrations‚ you don't even feel what's wrong with you‚ you don't know which direction you are moving‚ whether you are getting destroyed. And this balance has to be established by all the Sahaja Yogis.
These imbalances come to us because we still think about our past or maybe about our future. We worry about these things.

19880,Experiencing Vibrations,,,"After all we have to know why we have come to Sahaja Yoga. To begin at the root of it‚ we have come to Sahaja Yoga because we wanted to know the absolute truth. And this absolute truth has been now known to you through your vibrations. You know it through your vibrations‚ what is the absolute truth. And you should work everything on that line‚ that absolute truth‚ whatever you feel on your vibrations you have to follow. But unfortunately I have seen many people who think that their vibrations are alright – they are alright‚ and whatever they are receiving on their vibrations is first class. Now how to correct that point is very difficult – it comes from ego. When you have ego you can never find anything wrong with you. And even if the vibrations are telling you something it might be somebody else who's telling you something‚ because you are not there‚ your ego is there‚ and your ego is just spoiling you and teaching you things which normally you would see clearly that – ""I`m doing something wrong‚ I should not have done it"". In this process of correction and improvement‚ when you indulge you should see‚ are you getting subtler or grosser? That is the best way to judge.
Now I have seen people who go on judging all these small things on vibrations‚ like whether these vibrations are alright or not in this tree‚ or on these flowers or on this land‚ all these material things they want to see the vibrations. But for what are you seeing the vibrations? You are seeing vibrations because of some sort of a material gain. You think that if you check the vibrations and the vibrations are alright‚ then you are quite safe. You'll not lose this‚ you'll not lose that. It's not true. Because vibrations are not meant to judge all these worldly things and worldly matters. It's absolutely cheapening the vibrations. You should not cheapen them‚ because vibrations can suggest things which may be detrimental to your growth‚ very much.
Once I wanted somebody to go somewhere and so he said‚ ""I didn`t go Mother"" I said ""Why? ""Because I saw the vibrations were very bad"". I said ""that's why I asked you to go! If the vibrations were good‚ what was your use going there? I said ""The reason I asked you to go there was so that you could help‚ but before that you judged yourself‚ judged your vibrations and then you didn't want to go."" So what happens‚ we want to have an easy cosy life and all our problems must be solved by Sahaja Yoga otherwise we think Sahaja Yoga is of no use. Whatever is our desire must be fulfilled.",https://www.amruta.org/p/2232,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19890,Experiencing Vibrations,,,Fire can be used for two purposes. One is for burning out something and one for cooking food and doing things. So such person can create wonderful types of foods and interested in giving good food to people. And that food has vibrations. If the food of such a person has vibrations because it was cooked with that love‚ and passion‚ compassion. So that you take that food and you become a it can call a very tranquil person. Satisfied‚ you get with that very much satisfied. Now ones you people become satisfied materialism will be finished. Materialism will have no sense because what is it today you buy something then you go and buy another thing. Isn't it? It is‚ all the time you are dissatisfied. Today you want to have a table and tomorrow you want to have a sofa‚ then you want to have a car‚ you want to have a‚ endless. That finishes and you become very much satisfied. If you buy a table you will enjoy it. You buy a sofa you will enjoy it. You meet somebody you will enjoy it. So this particular nature that human being have is what you call a greed finishes. And he is a satisfied soul. He is a happy soul. And he enjoys himself. This is happening with the agni tatwa. Because this fire becomes a very silent‚ beautiful satisfying fire. In the subtle form when you get. Then there is jal tatwa (water principle)‚ is the water. Water which is being vibrated‚ which has got vibrations can cure you. But normally you take any water it's not going to cure you. But water which is vibrated by some saint or something can cure you. And also you must have heard of many places where they have waterfalls which what you can call are curative type. All this is the sutler side of these five elements. Then the Mother Earth‚ certain places are we call it as very sacred‚ for example Mecca. Now what is so special about Mecca. It's a stone there‚ that's all. What is so special? The special according to our puranas‚ our old literature‚ it's Makkeshwar Shiv itself. The God has come in the form of that stone according to Indian descriptions. You can imagine we have many Shivas and out of them one is Mecca.,https://www.amruta.org/p/10989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19900,Experiencing Vibrations,,,Those who are realized their souls have vibrations. They can feel the cool breeze in their hands. Even if they put hand in the water it is vibrated. All such people‚ saints and all that‚ whatever water comes from them is vibrated. For example the river‚ Ganga here‚ Ganges is‚ has got vibrations.

19910,Experiencing Vibrations,,,"You just feel the vibrations and see for yourself: if the vibrations are good‚ well and good. If they are not all right then should know that there is something wrong. You can judge any human being you like‚ you can judge any pastor or if you want to see any one of these millionaires and all those things‚ but first you must find out: that one‚ is he a perfect Sa- haja Yogi or not? This happens with the individuals. It can happen in the collective also. I have seen in the collective people are so much misled‚ and one negative person immediately knows who is the other negative‚ and then he gets hold of that negative and they start working together. So you have to be extremely cautious that you have got your Realization‚ you've got everything‚ you've got also lot of money in Sahaja Yoga. With all that you should know it's a very‚ very good sign for thieves to walk in. So you should be very careful and don't get charmed by all these nonsensical things. That's what is the protection from your Mother‚ that She wants to protect you in this way.
Our whole attitude towards life has to be that of a witness – you see everything clearly. Gradually this seeing will become so very sharp‚ so clear-cut‚ so understanding that you will be amazed.
Then you will be using some thing there‚ anything you are using. Then you don't have to think‚ only you have to know the vibrations: what are the vibrations are‚ what do the vibrations say‚ because they are there to guide you. Those who are not yet very good at vibrations should try to establish themselves. If you are not good at vibrations that means you will not judge people rightly‚ nor will they have knowledge properly.
So first you must get your‚ all your vibrations corrected and also chakras corrected. After that you can see what are your associates‚ who are they? See actually‚ your mind now is so enlightened that you can straightforward see everything before you.",https://www.amruta.org/p/446,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is you only who can decide. With vibrations you can immediately know that you are catching‚ or you will know you are right.
Whatever decision has to be taken‚ you have to use your hands fully. It's not talking that is going to help‚ it's not giving lectures that is going to help – no. It is through experimenting‚ through understanding‚ through the feelings or the deep‚ I should say the deep impact of everything that will communicate to you what sort of a people they are‚ what they are talking about‚ what you should do.

19940,Experiencing Vibrations,,,"Last time‚ I told you about the vibrations‚ what it is and what it stands for and how you get the subtle energy that we call as ""Tanmatra""‚ of our light‚ Tej‚ of water‚ Jal‚ and Vayu‚ Agni. But I didn't tell you of one‚ very special one which is in English language you call it Ether. But Ether is another energy which is managed by another Tanmatra‚ we call it Akash. Especially today‚ because it's Christ who has sacrificed His life to open our Agnya Chakra that we have reached that state of Akash. Without Him‚ it would not have been possible.
We can have general communication‚ like we can talk to people‚ we can say things‚ we can also use our fingers to express ourselves‚ our hands to communicate. But to communicate vibrations‚ you have to have vibrations. Otherwise you cannot feel another person. But if you are at the Agnya level‚ means you are mental‚ absolutely MENTAL‚ then your vibrations also are dwindling‚ in the sense you don't know really what they are saying. You can't judge your vibrations because these vibrations are mental. They say: ""Mother‚ we asked the vibrations."" I say: ""Really? But you don't have any vibrations‚ how can you ask the vibrations?"" Very common thing: ""We asked the vibrations‚ we found from the vibrations"". It's not possible‚ because you are just mental.

Why do you want to have some privacy? Because in Sahaja Yoga there's no privacy. We know about everyone‚ what are they up to‚ what are their problems‚ what chakras they are catching. Isn't it? So there is no secret about anything in Sahaja Yoga. Everyone knows about everyone. So what's the use of having privacy also‚ I can't understand.

If you do not have it with you then listen to those who have it and know it. You listen to them who have tried and tested it. By this you will be able to know that who is Satan and who is God. Who is real Guru and who is false.
In this world‚ there are natural flowers in the same way plastic flowers are also there. But their recognition is done by your eyes‚ nose and mouth or by all means that those are plastic [artificial] and those are real flowers. But to know the dharma you require vibrations only. Without it you will not be able to know whether this person is crafty or false or adharmik or a devil or a religious one. He is dharmik or an incarnation or is very powerful‚ you will not know unless and until you have divine vibrations on your hands.
Therefore you must first get this thing and real cool vibrations are coming from your hands.

If I hear such a song or listen a record or in cinema it is seen where Mother is being called then from My body crowds of waves of vibrations generate.
This you might have also experienced and seen also. You also understand that such is the quality [Love] of the Mother. Today the time has come where your asking‚ your wanting and your calling become manifested within Me. I have not come of My own‚ I have come on account of your calling Me.

20020,Dharma and Bhakti,,,"But those people who are coming to Sahaja Yoga have to be extremely dharmik‚ truthful and generous. They must learn complete explanation of dharma. Only vibrations will not work. Many people come before Me and vibrations go into them vigorously and when they go away then nothing happens.
In fact you must get vibrations from everywhere. Is there any place where I am not present? At every place you must feel vibrations and it must come so much that whatever you do‚ vibrations flow over you because you are living being.
Recently we sat at the place of Ganapati of [Rajanaon]. There we saw the Ganapati and found that less vibrations were coming. Those who were with Me were surprised to know why less vibrations are coming when it is an awakened place.
I told them‚ ""First you try to know that who has recognized this awaken- ing."" Is it found by a human being that it is an awakened place? He must have been a highly realized saint who might have seen the vibrations and said that it was a holy place. Then a vibrated stone might have been brought there. Maybe somebody might have moved around his hand to give a shape. It might be so and also might not be because a man's mind runs according to his own‚ isn't it? There was no necessity to touch it. After that in the temple its pujari [in charge of worship]‚ all his chakras were badly caught. Chakras of all pujaris who were there were caught. On it sindoor [vermilion]‚ donations‚ all those which had been offered were caught. One thing is naturally there in a man that it was an awakened and holy place but does not have that much sense that the vibrations coming from there is half of full. Three chakras of his [pujari's] were also caught. Even now I did not understand when I went inside the temple then Pundit told Me that‚ ""You cannot sit inside‚ you sit outside and you cannot touch it [statue of Ganapati]. Then I thought that if I could not touch it then the statue will remain like as before. Then I went from behind and saw the statue and went near it and put My Sahasrara on it. Then vibrations gushed out strongly. Therefore it must be understood that you are the living instrument of Divine. If we say within you‚ more vibrations can come out compared to these temples. But first of all you must be living instrument of Divine.",https://www.amruta.org/p/8443,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20030,Dharma and Bhakti,,,"You have to be firm on your position. First thing is you have to make your position. Second is you have to make your dharma. Dharma means you have to allow the flow of these vibrations out continuously.
Sometimes you desire to go somewhere‚ you see somebody has fallen down. Then run and take hold of him and give vibrations and save him. Let the world say anything. Vibrations are flowing from you and that is your dharma.
I have told you that the quality of gold is not that it is yellow. Its dharma is also not that ornaments can be made from it. Its dharma is only one and that it is never get spoiled by anything. Similarly diamond has its own dharma that it can cut everything. It is the hardest thing. In the same way the man has also his dharma to achieve God and know Him and those people who have achieved has their dharma to assimilate it completely and spread it all over the world.
But when you talk this and that then you will not get either of them. Your vibrations will vanish and all My efforts will become of no use.
There is no religion in the world where Divine vibrations have been told. It means nobody has said so that vibrations are dharma. They call it ""Ruh""‚ ""Water of Life"". They say anything but we say vibrations are real dharmas [religion].",https://www.amruta.org/p/8443,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20040,Dharma and Bhakti,,,"But in Sahaja Yoga is the other way round‚ like building first the pinnacle of the building‚ and then the foundation. Opening your Sahastrara was the first thing was achieved. And then in the light of Sahastrara you have to watch yourself and see for yourself. Gradually the introspection was a better thing‚ through vibrations is to see why: why I want this? Why my attention goes to my comfort? Why my attention goes to food‚ why to my family‚ why to my children‚ when I have to achieve the highest?
So you start introspecting yourself. Then you know on your vibrations also there's something wrong with you. Then you don't try to see others‚ what's wrong with others‚ you start seeing yourself; because it's your own ascent you have to achieve.
[  ...]",https://www.amruta.org/p/638,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20050,Dharma and Bhakti,,,"So whatever you desire‚ if you start working it out‚ desiring for something aesthetically handmade‚ nice thing‚ gradually you'll find you'll end up with vibrations‚ because all beautiful things have vibrations. And to have the vibrations you'll have to go to pure desire.
So this desire which is madness‚ which makes you mad‚ which is so much dull and boring becomes pure desire‚ because you have to dissolve all your desires into vibration. You start desiring nothing but vibrations af- ter some time. You'll not buy anything which has no vibrations. You'll not talk to a person who has no vibrations. If somebody has [no] vibrations you'll just run away.",https://www.amruta.org/p/638,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20060,Dharma and Bhakti,,,"So then what happens‚ all desire ends up into chaitanya‚ into vibrations. And if it does not‚ then you must know there's something still missing. But if you do not do this‚ then you end up into your destruction.
So to say that He's a destroyer is a very one-sided statement. He has both the powers. He has the power to give you vibrations. He gives you vibrations.
The Goddess is the power‚ Shakti‚ but He makes the vibrations. It's like these are the fingers‚ all right‚ but if they tickle you then it's Shiva. The fingers are that of the Goddess‚ all right‚ but if it tickles‚ you know‚ gives you joy‚ happiness‚ it's Shiva‚ is the bhakti. The joy of bhakti comes from Shiva. So if you have vibrations that doesn't mean that they are something dry‚ you see? No‚ it means the joy of bhakti. Bhakti is‚ you can call it adoration‚ this‚ that. It's the ocean of love that is God. You just get drenched into it. There's no words to it.
And that is what when you feel‚ you must know that you have taken the spirit as a real connection between you and your Mother‚ or your Father. There's no differentiation. You are one in that ocean‚ drenched in the ocean. You are the drop‚ you are the ocean. You are one in that bhakti. And that bhakti cannot be mechanical‚ because not man-made.
So to enjoy Sahaja Yoga you must know that it's not dry vibrations only‚ but is the bhakti. That is the joy of Shiva's quality‚ the quality of joy that He adds to our life.",https://www.amruta.org/p/638,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20070,Dharma and Bhakti,,,"But the fourth state is called as turya. There are two more states. You are in the turya state‚ it's the fourth‚ ""turya"" means fourth. Fourth state is where that you are in a thoughtless awareness state. When there is no thought – just think of it – when there is no thought‚ you have to be innocent. When there is no thought‚ you have to have vibrations. When there is no thought‚ you cannot be attached to anyone. So into that thoughtless state you have come now‚ is the ""turya sthiti."" And in this state when you are‚ these four petals which are within you have to open out in your brain. They come from your heart to your brain. And that is when you absolutely understand what is God‚ absolutely you know what is God is. That is the time when one receives the real knowledge.",https://www.amruta.org/p/638,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's God Almighty‚ which knows everything‚ which does everything‚ which enjoys everything. That is the one you should say is the gyana‚ is the knowledge‚ is the true knowledge‚ the pure knowledge. It's not the knowledge of chakras‚ not the knowledge of vibrations‚ not the knowledge of kundalini‚ but the knowledge of God Almighty.
And the knowledge of God Almighty is not mental. Again I tell you‚ it starts from your heart and goes to your brain‚ something that comes out of your experience of joy and covers your brain. So your brain cannot deny it any more.",https://www.amruta.org/p/638,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's a great day for us to celebrate this Shiva Puja here. I hope all of you respect the principle of Shiva within you‚ that's the most important.
And look after your vibrations‚ which pulsates in your being‚ because the Spirit has awakened in your attention‚ in your central nervous system. That's the most important thing you have to do.

20120,Dharma and Bhakti,,,The discrimination is the gift of Shri Krishna. Apart from anything else‚ He gives us the gift of discrimination. That is His style‚ I should say‚ to teach you how to discriminate and then you become experts on 'discrimination on vibrations'. On vibrations‚ you can judge everything so clearly‚ so beautifully. Others may not agree with you—that's a different point— but you know what is right and what is wrong. And that is what Shri Krishna's gift is.,https://www.amruta.org/p/2340,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Shri Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20130,Dharma and Bhakti,,,You must meditate‚ you must meditate‚ is very important‚ no question [that] without meditation you cannot keep yourself alright – it's no question. Meditation is the most important thing which must be followed because that's how you come close to Her vibrations‚ come to Her nature. Even animals are so sensitive to Mother‚ very sensitive to vibrations; an- imals are‚ but human beings have their own understanding‚ have their own freedom‚ have their so-called intelligence and they fall a trap to it; they follow things which they should not do.,https://www.amruta.org/p/2680,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20140,Dharma and Bhakti,,,I have seen animals have such a sensitivity to vibrations‚ extremely sensitive. How? Because their wisdom is intact. It works in them‚ they are not conscious of it. The difference is‚ human beings are conscious of their wisdom‚ that's the only difference. Animals have wisdom‚ but automatic‚ we should say‚ natural. But we have inculcated this‚ or we have developed this wisdom within us‚ through what? Through our meditation‚ through our understanding of bhakti and shraddha. So it's very important to understand the value of bhakti within us. You cannot superficially touch it. Those who are superficial will never get it.,https://www.amruta.org/p/2680,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20150,Dharma and Bhakti,,,So I have to tell you one thing that: before you people start spreading Sahaja Yoga‚ please judge yourself. Just see if you are wise. Also see for yourself if you have the blessings of the Mother. Only the wise are the people who know whether they have the Mother's blessings or not. For that we have so many ways of understanding. First and foremost thing is meditation and feeling your vibrations on the photograph and facing yourself clearly. If you are a realised soul‚ are you really a good realised soul or not? Are you deep or not? Are your vibrations working out or not? If you can see that then you will realise that greater than all ambitions‚ the greatest is to become a devoted‚ wise personality. That is the one that will give you the joy‚ joy for all kinds of things. Otherwise it is just a human being like others going about.,https://www.amruta.org/p/2680,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20160,Dharma and Bhakti,,,"So‚ for a Sahaja Yogi is important is introspection. Second one is meditation. And third one is to take vibrations. It's very important. What I find‚ some of them say‚ ""Mother‚ we don't do this‚ we don't do that‚"" ""But why? Why not do it?"" ""We do Sahaja Yoga!"" Sahaja Yoga‚ which part? If you are not doing these basic things‚ how are you a Sahaja Yogi? And then lots of complications come out of them‚ they also suffer. I think one has to have again the wisdom to understand what is Sahaja Yoga is. No one understands that sometimes‚ and they go on forming a group of people who are not at all understanding what is Sahaja Yoga. It's a very‚ very deep personality. Sahaja Yoga is not just by saying‚ ""I am a Sahaja Yogi‚"" but it's a very deep personality‚ and that deep personality has to be felt by others as the wise‚ very wise thing. Not that how much you talk or shout or give lectures is important; is with peace‚ the tranquillity‚ the capacity to love within you are important and that's how people can judge whether you are really blessed by your Mother or not.",https://www.amruta.org/p/2680,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20170,Vibrations and its use,,,"Now what is the beauty of Spirit is for a Sahaja Yogi. What does he get out of Spirit? What is the manifestation of spirit is that when his attention is absolutely one with the Atman‚ with the spirit then there is a manifestation of vibrations. You start getting cool breeze in your hands. Now these vibrations are there from the very beginning of the matter‚ up to the vibrations‚ where you come up to a human level. Say you can call them‚ these are electromagnetic vibrations. But when they go on improving‚ you see in the beginning‚ they just look like electromagnetic‚ then they look like more. There is emotions in it‚ you see then you go a little ahead then you find that these vibrations also act‚ these vibrations also think‚ they also report‚ so you see gradually you will find that with the growth of human being as a human being from matter these vibrations have also manifested into different categories. So begin with‚ these vibrations are only electromagnetic‚ you can say in the matter. Say you have Sulphur Dioxide as a molecule you'll find Sulphur and Dioxide both are vibrating all the time like that‚ but when it goes on manifesting more and more that's the basics then gradually the manifestation of these higher things can be perceived through our understanding of Sahaja Yoga but for a normal person it is only electromagnetic.
Now supposing a matter which is say‚ just a matter‚ say a dead matter‚ it is. Now it is not aware that it has got vibrations to begin with‚ it has not aware. It doesn't even think about it. I mean it has no awareness at all of any kind‚ it's just‚ so but there are vibrations there are electromagnetic vibrations which it is not aware. Now supposing such a dead matter if you tell that dead matter that you have vibrations it will say‚ ""what are you talking about?"" I never felt it‚ but somebody else can feel it that there are electromagnetic vibrations in the same way every human being has got these vibrations within him in the spirit but they are only manifested when he gets realization.
So the second category of the same thing‚ the same vibrations start expressing higher and higher qualities about it; like from one seed a tree moves and flowers come out and different fragrance like that‚ you see the growth is more and more. But the basic is electromagnetic vibrations that you can feel it everywhere in the matter with your naked eyes‚ a human being can see. Now see your own growth. Have you recognized it that animals don't know that there are electromagnetic vibrations but human beings.
But a Sahaja Yogi knows that there are not only electromagnetic but there are all kinds of manifestation of these vibrations. So electromagnetic are important at a point and then other vibrations are even much more important. So all these vibrations are combined together absolutely completely in human beings which they manifest gradually and they act according to the need of the time. So much so that in these vibrations there is a somebody who thinks‚ vibrations who think‚ the vibrations who cooperate‚ who cure‚ who relate things‚ who report things all that you think in the human awareness that you are doing like telecommunications you have got big telecommunications sitting down here. You say can show something that is happening in India or something like that. In the same way these vibrations can be blown things to (unclear‚ near meaning). the complete telecommunications is built in these vibrations then you can cure people sitting down‚ you can raise their kundalinis sitting down‚ you can work out on people sitting down here all these far fetched things are possible. Those who have been Sahaja Yogis have realized it and seen it and worked it out. And it's more surprising now we have a lady here sitting down; say her husband used to drink a lot‚ every- body knows her story very well and we just send some vibrations and he stopped drinking. He stopped his drinking and just to rinse that through vibrations it was done. I used something which is very simple it's a lime. It's a living lime and we put all the vibrations into that and we put them near the head of the patient and they suck the negativity of the person and the person gives up drinking.
We have seen one boy who used to come here‚ a little boy who would run all over the places and would not sit down for even for a minute. He was possessed‚ he was horrid and now he is a sensible boy. He started going to school. He never used to attend even a word and now he started speaking. So all these things happened with the lime. So‚ what how is it‚ Mother a lime is such a thing now‚ for a very up to date person it is funny to see limes being used for vibrations. They are actually ultramodern things you know‚ ultramodern. I am not talking of only modern but ultramodern things are limes; are very ultramodern things because you vibrate the ultramodern limes by your vibrations‚ and you put them under the pillow. Now these limes have a specialty these have been found out by many people long time back that they have a specialty to suck in the vibrations and contain the vibrations or to not only electromagnetic but quite a lot of vibrations can be in it‚ because they are living and they have a coefficience. They have a kind of coefficience by which they suck in these vibrations in them and then they relay‚ they throw these vibrations whenever it is necessary. It is not the limes who do it but the vibrations who are containing in them that they do it. How they are‚ I'll tell you.
You can think of a battery that you are creating. You create a battery. Now the battery can not do anything but if you take the battery near some points then it starts working because it is inside. In the same way we really make it into a battery. When they are near the heads of the people‚ these limes‚ you see they are doing nothing; but these vibrations come out and they start working it out. It's a perfect field. They do it. They know they are perfect. You don't have to tell them. They understand much more than you do. They are controlled much better and they know how to find the ways to extract the negativity‚ It sounds very funny to other people. You see that's why I tell only Sahaja Yogis don't give out all the secrets just now‚ let them come in slowly‚ let them settle down‚ let them get vibrations and then we'll talk because I've seen a few times if you not only talk but if they see some limes some people will run away‚ thinking its all hocus pocus.",https://www.amruta.org/p/1201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20180,Vibrations and its use,,,So vibrations are the most important things for Sahaja Yogis. Most important thing is to achieve a complete state of vibrations when your realization is completely integrated‚ your physical being‚ your emotional being‚ your spiritual being is complete [unclear]. It's a complete balance within you then only the vibrations flow and that's why Antaryoga is important. It is not only lecturing will help you but of course there are vibrations‚ they work out. I try to through My vibrations of My words to [unclear] but that is to a point. You have to yourself take up and work it out the Antaryoga‚ the inner yoga. By working it out in a way that you sit down meditate and do various things that Sahaja Yoga has suggested. Now I have you know that my grandchildren are realized souls and they're very high quality realized souls and they understand a lot about Kundalini from early childhood. Yesterday one of the girls was feeling the left nabhi very much‚ all over you see. She said now I will know how to do it and she brought pieces of paper and she tied them round her neck then she took vibrations so she said they are all passing into my this paper. Actually while doing she was giving bandhan to it she was moving her own vibrations around it‚ she was winding it and then she put them and she said alright put them in the fire and they burned them and her attention was reduced and everybody felt better.,https://www.amruta.org/p/1201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20190,Vibrations and its use,,,"Auspiciousness is judged through vibrations. So you can not say how are you to judge the auspiciousness? So through your vibrations you can so use your vibratory awareness for auspiciousness. That's how you can look after your Left side which I have told you in a very short way. For that you don't have to read books and you don't have to say‚ ""How many times‚ Mother‚ I should wash my hands? How many times I should give you these bandhan and all that?"" It's only when you get your vibrations that's the most auspicious time. Keep it at that point‚ because again and through the rituals you'll go‚ hold it with your left hand and hold it with your right hand and all going wrong and then some‚ ""oh‚ Mother I did the wrong way‚ what is it?"" That's all. The thing is the essence of it. If you get your vibrations alright‚ that's what is the auspiciousness. Maybe when you are sitting down you are not getting your vibrations‚ think that maybe something might go wrong with you. Is it I'm not revered properly? Let me have the vibrations. Why what's the matter‚ why is it that I am not feeling the vibrations? Well‚ that's how it should be. You can judge it through your vibrations. Now auspiciousness is very important for Sahaja Yogis because all that they do should be auspicious. Whatever is inauspicious you should not do.
Now you'll be surprised sometimes you might think that say going to a particular place but maybe you will find that you lost your purse or you cannot go there or may be that somehow or the other that the road is blocked‚ you might have to go back. Accept it. May be that is auspicious- ness may be that you have to go that way‚ may be there is somebody who is waiting for you there; you have to give your vibrations to that place.",https://www.amruta.org/p/1201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20200,Vibrations and its use,,,For example now in Bombay‚ they want to have an ashram. People have all funny ideas about ashram. They want to have an ashram‚ why having this ashram. Some people are very clever I know all of them. Because they can make some money out of it. Foolish things as they are. Then some of them think that by staying there we can pass our old age very nicely. You see it will be a cheap thing‚ because Mataji is not going to charge anything for stuff‚ so it will be a nice cheap thing. Let's buy one. Some of them are thinking its very good place where in young age we can go there and it will be a good idea‚ we can runaway from work. We stay in the ashram and after all Sahaja Yoga won't be that hard work you see. So it will be nice living there. All these considerations when they are in the minds of the people you'll never get your ashram. Take it from me. We'll sleep till ten o'clock‚ who is going to wake us up? We'll do whatever we like in the ashram. We'll use it for our own purpose. We will not do any meditation. We will not do anything‚ whatsoever. We'll do no work at all. We will not help anything in the organizing of Sahaja Yoga or organizing people. We will not bring them. After all what will happen? You'll lose your vibrations.,https://www.amruta.org/p/1201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20210,Vibrations and its use,,,But only thing that happens is that anybody who comes before Me just gets it‚ gets cured‚ and I'm nothing but vibrations. When you face Me‚ it just works. When I speak‚ it works. I don't do anything‚ rationally I don't understand. But these vibrations themselves‚ the energy goes‚ works it out‚ that works it out‚ that works it out. It works out all over‚ in the whole world. I do not consult It‚ I do not ask It. It's working on Its own. If I want I will ask‚ otherwise I will not. If I don't want to feel you‚ I will not feel you. There might be a rakshasa sitting next to Me‚ he might be shivering‚ but nothing will happen to Me. I can stop his shivering if I want to‚ if I don't want I will ask him to shiver. I am not bothered! Because when on vibrations the responsibility is there‚ on vibrations‚ which is My Light‚ I leave them alone. They are very well trained (the vibrations). They know everything‚ They are absolutely pure‚ as My name is‚ they are absolutely pure. I have no problem with them. I play here and there‚ that's a differ- ent point. I try to cover them up sometimes‚ I create a maya‚ it's different‚ that's another style. But as far as the vibrations are concerned‚ they are absolutely pure. That's why they are so effective. So keep your vibrations pure. Without any intention.,https://www.amruta.org/p/1201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20220,Vibrations and its use,,,"Be confident that you have powers. And this is the new change that is going to come within your own understanding.
So far only you knew that you could feel the vibrations‚ that you could cure people‚ you could help to cure — I mean still not so confident. That you could feel the Paramchaitanya. But you did not know what Dynamic Forces are working in you now and this a new change that is going to come.",https://www.amruta.org/p/13598,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20230,Vibrations and its use,,,You have to understand that all these powers are bubbling in you and just out of formality or maybe out of shyness or maybe little cowardice‚ you are hiding them.,https://www.amruta.org/p/13598,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20240,Vibrations and its use,,,Now you are responsible‚ not only for yourself‚ but for your ashrams‚ for your cities‚ for your countries and for the whole world. Now‚ assume your powers.,https://www.amruta.org/p/13598,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20250,Vibrations and its use,,,You know that by puja‚ you excite the chakras within Me and you get lots of vibrations‚ and you achieve‚ suddenly‚ a height in your awareness.,https://www.amruta.org/p/2874,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20260,Vibrations and its use,,,"It's very amazing how things work out. Immediately you will know a person is meditating or not‚ immediately. It's like he is a person who has given a bath to the child. Though he has given a bath to the child‚ still he has not taken a bath. You can make it out‚ the difference between the two. In the same way‚ those who have been meditating every day‚ morning and evening‚ not much time needed. You see‚ we waste all our time in something nonsensical. When there is complete understanding of yourself‚ and complete understanding of these vibrations‚ then only you can handle them properly. All this knowledge is for you. Is absolutely free as you know‚ and all this mastery can be yours. So do not just get satisfied: ""All right‚ today's Sunday‚ we'll go to the church‚ take the hymn book‚ let us sing this hymn number such-and-such‚ again sit down‚ get up‚ sit down."" Come back home just the same.
So today I have really thought of telling all of you that you have to develop the depth within yourself. And if you cannot develop that depth‚ then you are still a mediocre.",https://www.amruta.org/p/2874,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20270,Vibrations and its use,,,"We have got ten dharmas‚ the ten sustenances within us‚ Ten Commandments that we have to obey. Why? Because if you go out of them‚ then you go into an imbalance. And if the imbalance is set in‚ then you can develop any one of these problems which come out of the imbalances. That is how we cannot cure cancer‚ because we cannot make the cells go back to its normal condition. At the most what we can do is to remove the cells from the body who start attacking others and making them also ego-oriented. But we cannot make them again normal cells.
Only through vibrations you can do it‚ because when you vibrate these centers they become more powerful‚ they expand their aura so the circle that was small becomes bigger‚ engulfs both the sides and bring them together‚ and again the deities are awakened and the cells start getting the message from the whole. This is a simple principle‚ which is a subtle principle‚ but a person who gets the cancer‚ how will he know he's got a cancer or not? Because there is no way of knowing it. But when you become the knowledge‚ you start developing this sensation on your fingers and there are decoding words‚ decoding language which tells you which are the centers catching and how to cure it. Immediately you are on the alert‚ because you know it's happening. Now people who have‚ say‚ mental problems‚ they don't know they have mental problem. Some of them they are not at all aware‚ but then they realize they have a mental problem. A psychiatrist came to see Me‚ today only he was with Me‚ he is a Sahaja Yogi and he treated some mentally handicapped person. He's a psychiatrist‚ so he finds always this finger shakes before Me. This finger [left ring finger] and this thumb [left thumb]. If this is burning and this is shaking that means there's a possession working on you‚ a simple thing like that. Now this person can clear it out because a Sahaja Yogi takes hardly two minutes to clear it. But the person who has got it can be also cleared out‚ because once you know what is the center‚ and if you know the deities whom to awaken‚ and if you know how to awaken them‚ you get it cleared out. That's how mad people can also get cured.",https://www.amruta.org/p/1256,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20280,Vibrations and its use,,,"The Spirit is the only thing that is free within‚ which has no hangs-up‚ which has no habits‚ which does not stick on to anything‚ is complete- ly detached and emitting joy to us. It is a thing that makes our Spirit‚ our attention so enlightened. Now enlightened attention‚ as I said‚ is not the attention that we understand‚ that ""There's a light‚ we see the light‚"" nothing of the kind. But with this enlightened attention our awareness becomes enlightened‚ so that we start feeling other people on our hands.",https://www.amruta.org/p/1256,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20290,Vibrations and its use,,,When you get your Realization‚ your dharma‚ your Ten Commandments get enlightened. Means you get empowered‚ you become that. You go beyond religion; you don't have to follow it‚ you just become. You become so integrated. For example‚ some people it doesn't suit to have‚ say‚ pota- toes‚ they will just don't like it‚ just don't like it. Before Realization it is just the other way round‚ if they are not suppose to eat potatoes‚ they'll eat potatoes more. After Realization‚ you just won't have it‚ you won't have it‚ you are so integrated. The sustenance within us gets so enlightened that our priorities change completely; we start judging everything on vibrations.,https://www.amruta.org/p/1256,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20300,Vibrations and its use,,,"If you understand vibrations then it is very easy to retain your valences intact‚ because you are empowered.
Not only that‚ but you just don't like anything else‚ because you like the vibrations to flow. When the vibrations are flowing‚ the Spirit is emitting through your central nervous system the joy that is the quality of your Spirit. The joy you start feeling‚ and when you start feeling the joy‚ then you don't want to give up for anything‚ just don't want to give up. You want to enjoy it. So you become the knowledge‚ and the attention which is actually placed in this area and sustained by your liver becomes enlightened.",https://www.amruta.org/p/1256,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20310,Vibrations and its use,,,First time when you get Realization‚ first time‚ you feel that compassion‚ you feel those vibrations‚ you feel that all-pervading Power. You can now know that the all-pervading Power is there and then you can see the manoeuvring of it. You can work it out‚ you can work it out. Use it; you are the instrument‚ as I say. You are the master‚ only you have to become‚ assume that power.,https://www.amruta.org/p/1256,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20320,Vibrations and its use,,,"When you get your Realisation‚ then‚ with your vibrations‚ you can save all natural things that are decaying under the modern influence. So first of all we see the effect of Realisation how it acts as Ekadasha Rudra. It destroys the negative forces which are trying to destroy the nature.
One day I am sure you all will evolve to such a state that even your glance is sufficient to make the trees grow‚ to make the fruits sweet‚ to make the flowers fragrant. That's possible because our growth is showing results. Slowly‚ slowly‚ it is showing results‚ because you should not be stunned‚ you should not be shocked‚ so that you can see for yourself what you are and what you are achieving.
But to allow this force within us to grow first of all we should be very introspective‚ we should try to see ourselves‚ what is happening to us? We must watch our steps. Are we moving towards our construction or towards our destruction? What are we doing? This Ekadasha Rudra force which is within us is so powerful‚ is so very powerful that not only in nature but also in human beings it acts. It acts in a way that you are shocked and surprised.",https://www.amruta.org/p/2891,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20330,Vibrations and its use,,,"As I said that‚ modern times are the worst for these attacks [so] we have to be more alert‚ more aware‚ more understanding. As Sahaja Yogis you all are very well equipped. But we all the time forget that we have got our vibrations‚ that we have got a new awareness of vibrations. We have got vibratory awareness. And these vibratory awareness are a kind of a messenger which is absolute‚ which communicates and which tells us what's wrong with others‚ what's wrong with us.
But if you start taking your decision through you mental‚ emotional enterprises then be sure that you'll be misguided because all these endeavours are one sided. Like a mental projection goes like this in a linear way‚ falls upon you and also an emotional one does the same. Even the physical is just the same. But when you start seeing through the vibrations‚ what do you do is to ask your Spirit to communicate to you and the Spirit is the absolute knowledge. So you do not succumb to your conditioning or to your ego or to any other training or any other guru but yourself. So it is very important for all of you to understand that we are not going to take any decision on our mental level but on our vibrations.
Many people think that if I say something about someone‚ [it] may be be- cause they have reported it to me. But supposing if I am the source of all the vibrations‚ what is there for me to get reported? Why should anybody report to me? If they want to report they may but I know what exactly is the situation.",https://www.amruta.org/p/2891,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20340,Vibrations and its use,,,"So on vibrations you can know everything‚ but those who try to decide things without vibrations can make mistakes till you reach a certain stage where you don't have to spread your hands to ask‚ just you will know. But to go to that stage you have to first of all surrender your discretion to vibrations. Now some people don't have proper vibrations‚ maybe their Vishuddhis are bad. They should take proper care of their Vishuddhi. Even then‚ if they don't have some physical problem on the Vishuddhi‚ they can feel it within themselves‚ what chakras are catching‚ what is happening to this gentleman.
Normally‚ because we are in modern times‚ the people who are possessed appear more beautiful than the people who are not possessed. Once we had a lady who came to us in our programme. She was completely possessed‚ thin like a beanstalk‚ absolutely‚ and everybody – that was the beginning of Sahaja Yoga – felt that‚ ""What a beautiful woman has come!"" And I told them to keep her out of the hall for the time being. They couldn't understand.",https://www.amruta.org/p/2891,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20350,Vibrations and its use,,,"There is no need to go to Himalayas. The – whatever is covering is in the Himalayas‚ is what is nothing but the water from the sea only. It's one of the circles‚ that water passes to the Himalayas‚ then comes back as rivers‚ again falls into the same sea. They have to come to the sea. So it is everything ends up here. And then it is allowed – it goes through tapasya – it allows the Sun to create that cloud by suffering the heat‚ heat of the Sun‚ and becomes vapours‚ and then it goes as clouds and you get your rain. In the same way we have to be; we have to bear the heat of others‚ the anger of others and create vapours – means the blessings‚ the vibra- tions for others. It is with Me‚ same thing. When I see somebody who is sick and I treat him‚ of course I have to bear a little bit‚ sometimes quite a lot‚ then I absorb it and then they become vibrations. They just start flowing as vibrations. So this is what you have to learn from the sea‚ which is very important for sahaja yogis‚ that you absorb everything‚ doesn't matter. But don't get attached to it‚ and let it become vapours‚ and the Sea can now become the vapours. As you all are here‚ all these vapours as vibrations should flow.
This method you should try to understand by courage. Because the other day when I was coming‚ there was a lady sitting just on the way: ""Mother‚ her feet are out of order‚ or something gone wrong. Please treat her."" Why should I treat? Why can't you treat? Are you afraid to treat someone? Then there's another one who comes up to say: ""Mother‚ You treat her."" Why can't you treat? You all can treat them‚ you can help them‚ and you'll be surprised‚ the more you'll treat them the better you will be. You should venture‚ you should have that much courage to treat others. If you don't treat others you won't grow because that is what‚ like the sea‚ as you have seen‚ you become the vibrations. And when you treat others there are more vibrations. Why should God give you vibrations if you are not going to use it? Simple logic. Why should God give you light if you are not going to use it? Christ has said that‚ ""You don't put light under a measure."" That's what we are doing when we are not using our hands‚ our feet‚ our brains for Sahaja Yoga: we are not creating vibrations within ourselves.
The same body that is yours can just become a bundle of vibrations‚ if you start using these vibrations. But if you don't use these vibrations you'll have problems‚ the problems‚ all the time‚ and you will not understand: ""Why? I am doing everything‚ I am doing this"" – because you are not using your vibrations.
You have to use your vibrations in every way possible‚ wherever is possible‚ to help others to get all right‚ to get well. You can at the most take a bandhan if you like‚ if you think that it might hurt you or something‚ but at least use My photograph. And after the photograph you can just touch the person‚ there's no harm. After all‚ if you are afraid even of any troubles‚ then what's the use of becoming a sahaja yogi? If the ship is not seaworthy‚ what's the use of making a ship? You have to be seaworthy. And that's what you have to decide‚ that: ""We are going to be Sahaja Yoga worthy‚ and for that we are going to absorb all the vibrations‚ we are go- ing to take up everything upon ourselves."" Little trouble also they have‚ they'll tell Me ten times: ""We went there‚ then this happened‚ then that happened‚ then this."" But I never tell you anything‚ what happens to Me‚ how I came here‚ what was there; nothing! Because I know that all this is‚ whatever I am doing‚ is created into vibrations.
In the same way have faith‚ that you are all just like the sea‚ like the Mahaguru‚ and that whatever you are doing is creating vibrations within you‚ by which you can save so many.
It's something like a cycle again‚ I said‚ that the more you give‚ the more you get. The more you use your vibrations‚ much more you'll get it. It's a very nice cycle that is acting as it has acted in the case of the sea‚ as I told you‚ that the water goes to the Himalayas‚ comes back at rivers. In the same way manifold‚ manifold your vibrations will be growing‚ and I would say that you should always use our vibrations for helping others‚ for giving to many things‚ to the plant‚ to the anything. I mean there were some people who brought a plant: ""Mother‚ give vibrations to that."" I said: ""Why don't you give the vibrations?""
There's no need even to take vibrated water. You can vibrate yourself. That state has to come‚ that you can vibrate your own water‚ you can vibrate the whole waters everywhere‚ there's no need to take vibrated water from Me. Maybe Mine is a little more‚ but doesn't matter!",https://www.amruta.org/p/6567,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20360,Vibrations and its use,,,"The second one is the kind of food you are eating here is not so fresh. Try to eat fresh food. At least in Australia you can get it‚ as far as possible. Take to more carbohydrates‚ if you are thinking too much‚ best is to take to carbohydrates. You are so much worried about putting on weight or this thing. I don't know why you want to be skinny. What is the need? On the contrary‚ a person who has little plumpness‚ absorbs vibrations much better. But do you know that vibrations sit on the fat? Medhastitha – they sit on the fat. And that's why they go on the nerves because nerve is made of fat. Your brain is also made of fat. So try to understand what is good for your body‚ and what you should do. Massaging your body is a very good thing. I think‚ without oil I cannot exist‚ really. Because My work is on Sahastrara and if I starve My Hair‚ either I'll become completely bald or mad; one of the two. It's very soothing to massage your hair‚ very soothing for your nerves‚ everything‚ and you are realized souls‚ there's vibrations flowing. You should massage your head nicely.
Take about an hour‚ on a Saturday. Saturday is the day of shani‚ is the day of Saturn‚ the day of Shri Krishna. He is so fond of butter and oil. All these small small things should be understood.",https://www.amruta.org/p/2017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20370,Vibrations and its use,,,When you see the ills of society‚ that has taken so much of toll‚ of so many young generation‚ I think Sahaja Yogis have a very great responsibility‚ towards their fellow man in their own country. We talk of so many things but actually you'll be surprised you all are gifted with the power to emit‚ vibrations by which you can correct the society. You are all the channels of those beautiful vibrations‚ which you must use and utilize. But if you do not pay attention‚ to your vibrations‚ and to your growth‚ then all these‚ subtle powers that you have do not manifest. That is what I feel about Sahaja Yogis yet‚ they have not realized how important they are‚ and what is their role‚ much more than any other Incarnations‚ disciples‚ Incarnations' pupils‚ had. Because you yourself‚ you are realized souls. You yourself know all the things. All the subtleties you have‚ and if you can just understand that by spreading Sahaja Yoga you also go much deeper‚ within yourself‚ you will take it up and work it out.,https://www.amruta.org/p/6412,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20380,Vibrations and its use,,,Now what should be the attitude of a Sahaja Yogi towards taking decisions‚ one should understand. It should be a spontaneous decision. You do not have to tally with this‚ go there and find out‚ immediately and spontaneously‚ like Shri Krishna who jumped inside the river. So in the same way you should have a very spontaneous decision for anything.,https://www.amruta.org/p/2349,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Shri Krishna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20390,Vibrations and its use,,,"All this thinking and all kinds of decision making and having a big conference for decisions and all that will not do it. In day-to-day life also you have to be like that. Also in every political life‚ economic life or any other life you have to lead you have to be very spontaneous. How do you become spontaneous? What quality I have got‚ what is the weapon you have got to know what decision to take? Do you know you have got vibrations? You have the feel of the vibrations. You know what vibrations are. You know what vibrations tell you and convey and communicate you. They speak to you. So through your vibrations you should know in a second what should you do. For example now somebody told me that ""Mother when I come to Cabella I feel tremendous vibrations"". It's a fact. But how many of you feel that way? Because your sensitivity is not yet developed. You have to be sensitive about your vibrations. You should know looking at anyone‚ sitting next to anyone‚ even shaking hands with anyone you should know what sort of vibrations that person has. This kind of sensitivity if you develop‚ then you will definitely take very spontaneous decisions.",https://www.amruta.org/p/2349,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20400,Vibrations and its use,,,"You should know that a Goddess doesn't come with your own demands‚ She comes on Her own. She has Her own timing. But if you are people in majority who have really become saints and making others saintly – then I am for you! Otherwise I am available to you – you can have My vibrations‚ you can have My Pujas‚ all these things are permitted‚ no doubt. But for that‚ you're only capable‚ you are only entitled for that‚ if you are doing Sahaja Yoga. If you are spreading Sahaja Yoga. If you are giving to others. Then only you will be considered really capable of receiving the vibrations of the Goddess.
In some countries if it is so much powerful‚ why not with your country‚ with your neighbourhood‚ with your friends‚ with your relations‚ it's possible.
So tonight you have to decide that you are going to dedicate yourself in giving it to others. It is very joy-giving. And talking about Sahaja Yoga.",https://www.amruta.org/p/2615,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
